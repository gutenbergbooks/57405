<p class="ph2">ALL ALONG THE RIVER.</p>




<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></p>

<p class="center">"THE RAIN SET EARLY IN TO-NIGHT."</p>


<p>It had been raining all the morning, and it was raining still, in that
feeble and desultory manner which presages a change of some kind, when
the postman came with the long-expected Indian letter.</p>

<p>He was later than usual. It was nearly two o'clock, and Isola had been
watching for him since one, watching with an unread book in her lap,
listening for the click of the gate. She had been sitting by the open
window, looking out at the wet landscape, the glistening hedgerow and
dull grey river, with the great, green hill beyond, a steep slope of
meadow land, dotted with red cattle, and so divided by hedgerows, as to
look like a Titanic chessboard.</p>

<p>At last she heard the familiar tread of the postman's heavy boots, and
saw his shining oilskin hat moving above the edge of the hollies, and
heard the click of the iron latch as he came into the little garden.</p>

<p>She called to him from the window, and he came tramping across the
sodden grass and put three letters into her outstretched hand.</p>

<p>One from her married sister in Hans Place. That would keep. One from an
old schoolfellow. That would keep. And one&mdash;the long-looked-for Indian
letter, which she tore open eagerly, and read hurriedly, devouring
the close lines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> in the neat, black penmanship, with its decided
up and down strokes, and legible characters, so firm, so strong, so
straightforward, like the nature of the man who wrote the letter.</p>

<p>The tears sprang to her eyes as she came to the end, and her hands
crushed the thin paper in a paroxysm of vexation or despair.</p>

<p>"Six months&mdash;perhaps a year, before he can come back, and I am to go
on living here&mdash;alone, unless I like to send for a girl whose face I
hardly know, to keep me company, and cheer me with her good spirits. I
want no strange girls. I want no one's good spirits. I hate people with
good spirits. I want him, and nobody but him! It is hard that we should
be parted like this. I ought to have gone with him, in spite of all the
doctors in Christendom."</p>

<p>She relented towards the letter which her feverish hand had used so
badly. She smoothed out the flimsy paper carefully with that pretty
little hand, and then she re-read the husband's letter, so full of
grave tenderness and fond, consoling words.</p>

<p>He was with his regiment in Burmah, and the present aspect of things
gave him no hope of being able to return to England for the next
half-year, and there was no certainty that the half-year might not be
stretched into a whole year. The separation could not be more irksome
to his dearest Isola than it was to him, her husband of little more
than a year: but not for worlds would he have exposed her to the risks
of that climate. He took comfort in thinking of her in the snug little
Cornish nest, with his good Tabitha.</p>

<p>Isola kissed the letter before she put it in her pocket, and then she
looked round the room rather dolefully, as if the Cornish nest were
not altogether paradise. And yet it was a pretty little room enough,
half dining-room, half study, with handsomely bound books on carved oak
shelves, and photographs and bright draperies, and cosily cushioned
bamboo chairs, and a bird-cage, and a Persian cat. Nor was the garden
outside flowerless, even on the threshold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> of winter. The purple
blossoms of the veronica were untouched by frost; there were pale tea
roses gleaming yonder against the dark gloss of holly and laurel. There
were single dahlias of vividest red, like flaming stars; and close
under the open window, last splendour of departed summer, the waxen
chalice of a golden lily trembled on its tall stem, and filled the room
with perfume.</p>

<p>The rain was over&mdash;the monotonous drip, drip, which had irritated
Isola's nerves all that morning, had ceased at last. She left the
modest little lunch untouched upon the table, and went out into the
hall, where her hat and jacket hung handy for any impromptu ramble.
No need to look at one's self in the glass before going out of doors,
at twenty years of age, and in such a place as Trelasco. Isola took
her stick from the stand, a green orange stick, bought in the sunny
South, on her way to Venice with her husband last year&mdash;a leisurely
trip, which had been to them as a second honeymoon after a few happy
months of wedlock. Then had come the sadness of parting, and a swift
and lonely journey for the young wife&mdash;a lonely return to the Angler's
Nest, Trelasco, that cosy cottage between Lostwithiel and Fowey, which
Major Disney had bought and furnished before his marriage. He was a
son of the soil, and he had chosen to pitch his tent in that remote
spot for the sake of old associations, and from a fixed belief that
there was no locality of equal merit for health, beauty, and all other
virtues which a man should seek in his home.</p>

<p>Isola rarely touched that stick without remembering the day it was
bought&mdash;a rainy day in Milan&mdash;just such a day as this, a low, grey sky,
and an oppressive mildness of atmosphere. She remembered, with the sick
pain that goes with long partings, how she and her husband had dawdled
away an afternoon in the Victor Emmanuel Gallery, buying handkerchiefs
and neckties, a book or two, a collection of photographs, and finally
the orange stick.</p>

<p>She went out to walk down her depression before teatime, if possible.
She went along a narrow path by the river, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> turned into a road
that skirted those green pastures which rose sheer till the ragged edge
of the topmost boundary seemed to touch the dim, grey sky. She passed
the village inn, deadly quiet at this season and at this hour. She
passed the half-dozen decent cottages, and the three or four genteeler
houses, each in its neatly kept garden, and she walked with quick,
light step along the wet road, her useful tailor-gown well clear of the
mud, her stick striking the hedgerow now and then, as she swung it to
and fro in dreamy thought.</p>

<p>A long, lonely winter to look forward to&mdash;a winter like the last&mdash;with
her books and drawing-board, and her cottage piano, and the cat and the
fox-terrier, and Tabitha for her daily companions. There were a few
neighbours within a radius of half a dozen miles, who had been very
civil to her; who called upon her, say once in six weeks; who sometimes
invited her to a stately dinner-party, and sometimes at a suspiciously
short notice, which made her feel she was wanted to fill a gap; who
made her free of their tennis lawns; and who talked to her on Sundays
after church, and were always very particular in inquiring for news
from India. There was not one among them for whom she cared; not one
to whom she would have liked to pour out her thoughts about Keats or
Shelley, or to whom she would have confided her opinion of Byron. She
was more interested in Bulwer's "Audley Egerton" than in any of those
flesh and blood neighbours. She was happier sitting by her chimney
corner with a novel than in the best society available within a drive
of Trelasco.</p>

<p>She struck off the high road into a lane, a lane that led to the base
of a wilder hill than that where the red cattle were grazing. The
crest of the hill was common land, and dark fir-trees made a ragged
line against the autumn sky, and the view from the summit was wide and
varied, with a glimpse of the great brown cliffs and the dark, grey
sea far off to the west, to that dim distance where the Dodman shut
off the watery way to the new world. On the landward slope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> that
wild-looking ridge was the Mount, Lord Lostwithiel's place, uninhabited
for the greater part of the year except by servants, his lordship being
the very last kind of man to bury himself alive in a remote Cornish
fastness, a long day's journey from the London theatres, and the R.Y.S.
Clubhouse at Cowes.</p>

<p>Who was Lord Lostwithiel? Well, in the estimation of Trelasco he was
the only nobleman in England, or say that he was to all other peers as
the sun to the planets. He belonged to Trelasco by reason of his large
landed estate and the accident of his birth, which had taken place
at the Mount; and, although his character and way of life were not
altogether satisfactory to the village mind, Trelasco made the best of
him.</p>

<p>Isola Disney climbed the hill, an easy matter to light-footed twenty.
She stood amidst the tall fir columns, and looked down at the November
landscape, very distinctly defined in the soft, grey atmosphere. She
could see the plough moving slowly across the red earth in the fields
below, the clumsy farm horses, white against the deep, rich red. She
could see the winding river, bluish grey, between its willowy banks,
and far off beyond Fowey there rose the wooded hills, where the foliage
showed orange and tawny and russet between the blue-grey water and the
pale grey sky.</p>

<p>She loved this lonely hill, and felt her spirits rise in this lighter
atmosphere as she stood resting against the scaly trunk of a Scotch
fir, with the wind blowing her hair. It was a relief to escape from the
silence of those empty rooms, where she had only the sleepy Persian or
the hyper-intelligent fox-terrier for company. There was a longer and
more picturesque way home than that by which she had come. She could
descend the other side of the hill, skirt the gardens of the Mount, by
a path that led through the Park to a lodge gate on the Fowey road. It
was one of her favourite walks, and she was so accustomed to seeing the
shutters closed at the great house that she never expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> to meet any
one more alarming than a farm-servant or a cottager's child.</p>

<p>There was a thick chestnut copse upon one side, and the wide expanse
of undulating turf, with an occasional clump of choice timber, upon
the other. The house stood on higher ground than the park, but was
hemmed in and hidden by shrubberies that had overgrown the intention
of the landscape gardener who planned them. Only the old grey-stone
gables, with their heavy slabs of slate, and the tall, clustered
chimneys, showed above the copper beeches, and deodaras, the laurels,
and junipers, and Irish yews, and the shining masses of arbutus with
crimson berries gleaming amongst the green. Isola had never seen that
old Manor House nearer than she saw it to-day, from the path, which
was a public right of way through the park. She knew that the greater
part of the building dated from the reign of Charles the Second, but
that there were older bits; and that about the whole, and about those
ancient rooms and passages most especially, there were legends and
traditions and historical associations, not without the suspicion of
ghosts. The Mount was not a show place, like the home of the Treffrys
at Fowey, and of late years it had been very seldom inhabited, except
by certain human fossils who had served the house of Hulbert for two
generations. She had often looked longingly at those quaint old gables,
those clustered stone chimneys, likening the house amidst its overgrown
shrubberies to the Palace of the Sleeping Beauty, and had wished that
she were on friendly terms with one of those drowsy old retainers.</p>

<p>"I dare say if I were daring enough to open one of the doors and go in
I should find them all asleep," she thought, "and I might roam all over
the house without awakening anybody." She was too depressed to-day to
give more than a careless, unseeing glance at those many gables as she
walked along the muddy path beside the dripping copse. The chestnut
boughs were nearly bare, but here and there clusters of bright yellow
leaves were still hanging, shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> like pale gold in the last watery
gleams of the sun; and though the leaves were lying sodden and brown
among the rank, wet grass, there were emerald mosses and cool, green
ferns, and red and orange fungi to give colour to the foreground, and
to the little vistas that opened here and there amidst the underwood.</p>

<p>Those final yellow gleams were fading low down in the western sky as
Isola turned her face towards the river and the Angler's Nest, and just
above that pale radiance there stretched a dense black cloud, like a
monstrous iron bar, which she felt must mean mischief. She looked at
that black line apprehensively. She was three miles from home, without
cloak or umbrella, and with no available shelter within three-quarters
of a mile.</p>

<p>She quickened her pace, watching the fading light and lowering cloud,
expecting thunder, lightning, hail, she knew not what. A sudden deluge
settled the question. Torrential rain! That was the meaning of the inky
bar above the setting sun. She looked round her helplessly. Should she
dart into the copse, and try to shelter herself amidst those leafless
twigs, those slender withies and saplings? Better to face the storm
and plod valiantly on. Her neat little cloth gown would not be much
the worse for a ducking; her neat little feet were accustomed to rapid
walking. Should she run? No; useless when there were three miles to
be got over. A brisk, steady tramp would be better. But, brave as she
was, that fierce rain was far from pleasant. It cut into her eyes and
blinded her. She had to grope her way along the path with her stick.</p>

<p>"Pray let me take you to the house," said a voice close beside her, a
man's voice&mdash;low and deep, and with the accents of refinement.</p>

<p>Could one of Lord Lostwithiel's fossilized servants talk like that?
Impossible. She looked up, as well as she could, under that blinding
downpour, and saw a tall man standing beside the pathway with his back
to the copse. He was over six feet two and of slim, active figure. He
was pale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> and wore a short, dark beard, and the eyes which looked at
Isola out of the pale, thin face were very dark. That was about as much
as she could see of the stranger in the November dusk.</p>

<p>"Pray let me persuade you to come to the house," he said urgently. "You
are being drenched. It is absolutely dreadful to see anybody out in
such rain&mdash;and there is no other shelter within reach. Let me take you
there. My housekeeper will dry your hat and jacket for you. I ought to
introduce myself, perhaps. I am Lord Lostwithiel."</p>

<p>She had guessed as much. Who else would speak with authority in that
place? She dimly recalled a photograph, pale and faded, of a tall man
in a yeomanry uniform, seen in somebody's album; and the face of the
photograph had been the same elongated oval face&mdash;with long thin nose,
and dark eyes a shade too near together&mdash;which was looking down at her
now.</p>

<p>She felt it would be churlish to refuse shelter so earnestly offered.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she faltered. "I am sorry to be so troublesome. I
ought not to have come so far in such doubtful weather."</p>

<p>She went with him meekly, walking her fastest under the pelting rain,
which was at her back now as they made for the house.</p>

<p>"Have you really come far?" he asked.</p>

<p>"From Trelasco. I live at the Angler's Nest, a cottage by the river.
You know it, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I know every house at Trelasco. Then you are staying with Mrs.
Disney, I presume?"</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Disney."</p>

<p>"You?"&mdash;with intense surprise. "I beg your pardon. You are so young. I
imagined Mrs. Disney an older person."</p>

<p>He glanced at the girlish figure, the pale delicate face, and told
himself that his new acquaintance could scarcely be more than nineteen
or twenty. He had met Major Disney, a man who looked about forty&mdash;a
lucky fellow to have caught such a pretty bird as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>They had reached the shrubbery by this time, and were hurrying along
a winding walk where the rain reached them with less violence. The
narrow walk brought them on to a broad terrace in front of the house.
Lostwithiel opened a half-glass door, and led Mrs. Disney into the
library, a long, low room, full of curious nooks and corners, formed by
two massive chimney-pieces, and by the projecting wings of the heavy
oak bookcases. Isola had never seen any room so filled with books, nor
had she ever seen a room with two such chimney-pieces, of statuary
marble, yellowed with age, elaborately carved with cherubic heads, and
Cupids, and torches and festal wreaths, bows and arrows, lyres and urns.</p>

<p>A wood fire was burning upon one hearth, and it was hither Lostwithiel
brought his guest, wheeling a large armchair in front of the blaze.</p>

<p>"If you will take off your hat and jacket, and sit down there, I'll get
my housekeeper to attend to you," he said, with his hand upon the bell.</p>

<p>"You are more than kind. I must hurry home directly the rain abates a
little. I have a careful old servant who is sure to be anxious about
me," said Isola, devouring the room with her eyes, wanting to take in
every detail of this enchanted castle.</p>

<p>She might never enter it again, perhaps. Lord Lostwithiel was so seldom
there. His absenteeism was the lament of the neighbourhood. The things
he ought to have done and did not do would have filled a book. He had
been wild in his youth. He had once owned a theatre. He had done, or
was supposed to have done, things which were spoken of with bated
breath; but of late years he had developed new ambitions, and had done
with theatrical speculations. He had become literary, scientific,
political. He was one of the lights of the intellectual world, or of
that small section of the intellectual world which is affiliated to the
smart world. He knew all the clever people in London, and a good many
of the intellectualities of Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> Berlin, and Vienna. He had never
married; but it was supposed that he would eventually marry, before he
was forty, for instance, and that he would make a great match. He was
not rich, but he was Lord Lostwithiel. He was by no means handsome, but
he was said to be one of the most fascinating men in London.</p>

<p>Isola pulled off her jacket slowly, looking about her all the time; and
Lostwithiel forbore from offering her any assistance, lest he should
intensify her evident shyness.</p>

<p>A man in plain clothes, who looked more like a valet than a butler,
answered the bell.</p>

<p>"Send Mrs. Mayne, and bring tea," ordered his lordship.</p>

<p>What a slender, girlish form it was which the removal of the tweed
jacket revealed! The slim waist and somewhat narrow shoulders betokened
a delicacy of constitution. The throat was beautiful, milk white, the
throat of Diana, and the head, now the hat was off, would also have
done for Diana; a small classic head, with soft, brown hair drawn
smoothly away from the low, white brow and rolled into a knot at the
back. The features were as delicate as the complexion, in which there
was no brilliancy of colouring, only a paleness as of ivory. The eyes
were dark grey, with long, brown lashes, and their present expression
was between anxiety and wondering interest. Lostwithiel was not such a
coxcomb as to appropriate that look of interest. He saw that it was his
house and not himself which inspired the feeling.</p>

<p>"You like old houses, I can see, Mrs. Disney," he said, smiling at her.</p>

<p>"Intensely. They are histories in brick and stone, are they not? I dare
say there are stories about this room."</p>

<p>"Innumerable stories. I should have to ransack the Record Office for
some of them, and to draw upon a very bad memory to a perilous extent
for others."</p>

<p>"Is it haunted?"</p>

<p>"I am not one of those privileged persons who see ghosts; neither
seventh son of a seventh son, nor of the mediumistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> temperament; but
I have heard of an apparition pervading the house on occasions, and
being seen in this room, which once formed part of a certain small
monastery, put down by Henry VIII., and recorded in the Black Book. As
one of the oldest rooms it is naturally uncanny; but as I have never
suffered any inconvenience in that line, I make it my den."</p>

<p>"It is the most picturesque room I ever saw. And what a multitude of
books!" exclaimed Isola.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have a good many books. I am always buying; but I find I never
have exactly the book I want. And as I have no librarian I am too apt
to forget the books I have. If I could afford to spend more of my life
at the Mount, I would engage some learned gentleman, whose life had
been a failure, to take care of my books. Are you Cornish, like your
husband, Mrs. Disney?"</p>

<p>"No. I was born at Dinan."</p>

<p>"What! in that mediæval Breton city? You are not French, though, I
think?"</p>

<p>"My mother and father were both English, but my sister and I were born
and brought up in Brittany."</p>

<p>Lostwithiel questioned no further. He had a shrewd idea that when
English people live for a good many years in a Breton town they have
reasons of their own, generally financial, for their choice of a
settlement. He was a man who could not have spent six months of his
life away from London or Paris.</p>

<p>The housekeeper made her appearance and offered her services. She wrung
the rain out of Isola's cloth skirt, and wiped the muddy hem. She took
charge of the jacket and hat, and at Lostwithiel's suggestion she
remained to pour out the tea. She was a dignified person, in a black
silk gown and a lace cap, and she treated her master as if he had been
a demi-god. Isola could not be afraid of taking tea in this matronly
presence, yet she kept looking nervously towards the window in front of
her, where the rain beat with undiminished force, and where the night
was closing in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see you are anxious to be on your way home, Mrs. Disney," said
Lostwithiel, who had nothing to do but watch her face, such an
expressive face at all times, so picturesquely beautiful when touched
by the flickering light of the wood fire. "If you were to wait for
fine weather you might be here all night, and your good people at home
would be frantic. I'll order a carriage, and you can be at home in
three-quarters of an hour."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Lord Lostwithiel, I couldn't give you so much trouble. If your
housekeeper will be so kind as to lend me a cloak and umbrella, I can
get home very well. And I had better start at once."</p>

<p>"In the rain, alone, and in the darkness? It will be dark before you
are home, in any case. No, Mrs. Disney, if I were to permit such a
thing I should expect Major Disney to call me out directly he came
home. He is in India, I think?"</p>

<p>"He is with his regiment in Burmah."</p>

<p>"Do you expect him home soon?"</p>

<p>"Not very soon; not for six months, or perhaps longer. It was that
which made me walk so far."</p>

<p>Lostwithiel looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I mean that I was so disappointed by his letter&mdash;a letter I received
to-day&mdash;that I went out for a long ramble to walk down my bad spirits,
and hardly knew how far I was going. It has made me inflict trouble on
you, and Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mayne. Both Mrs. Mayne and I are delighted to be of use to you. Order
the station brougham, Dalton, immediately," to the man who answered his
bell. "The carriage can hardly be ready in less than twenty minutes, so
pray try to do justice to Mrs. Mayne's tea."</p>

<p>"It is delicious tea," said Isola, enjoying the fire-glow, and the
dancing lights upon the richly bound books in all their varieties of
colouring, from black and crimson and orange-tawny to vellum diapered
with gold.</p>

<p>She was evidently relieved in her mind by the knowledge that she was to
be driven home presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you are really interested in this old house you must come some
sunny morning and let Mrs. Mayne show you over it," said Lostwithiel,
establishing himself with his cup and saucer upon the other side of the
hearth. "She knows all the old stories, and she has a better memory
than I."</p>

<p>"I should like so much to do so next summer, when my husband can come
with me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Major Disney won't care much about the old place. He is a
native of these parts, and must have been here often in my father's
time. I shall hope to receive you both, if I am here next October for
the shooting&mdash;but there is no need to postpone your inspection of the
house to the remote future. Come on the first fine morning that you
have nothing better to do. Mrs. Mayne is always at home; and I am
almost always out of doors in the morning. You can have the house to
yourselves, and talk about ghosts to your hearts' content."</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord, I hope I know better than to say anything disrespectful
of the house," protested Mrs. Mayne.</p>

<p>"My dear Mayne, a family ghost is as respectable an institution as a
family tree."</p>

<p>Isola murmured some vague acknowledgment of his civility. She was far
too shy to have any idea of taking advantage of his offer. To re-enter
that house alone of her own accord would be impossible. By-and-by, with
her husband at her side, she would be bold enough to do anything, to
accept any hospitality that Lostwithiel might be moved to offer. He
would invite Martin, perhaps, for the shooting, or to a luncheon, or
a dinner. She wondered vaguely if she would ever possess a gown good
enough to wear at a dinner-party in such a house.</p>

<p>After this there came a brief silence. Mrs. Mayne stood straight and
prim behind the tea-table. Nothing would have induced her to sit in
his lordship's presence, albeit she had dandled him in her arms when
there was much less of him than of the cambric and fine flannel which
composed his raiment, and albeit his easy familiarity might have
invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> some forgetfulness of class distinctions. Mrs. Mayne fully
understood that she was wanted there to set the stranger at her ease,
and she performed her mission; but even her presence could not lessen
Isola's shyness. She felt like a bird caught in a net, or fluttering
in the grasp of some strong but kindly hand. She sat listening for
carriage wheels, and only hearing the dull thumping of her own scared
heart.</p>

<p>And yet he was so kind, and yet he so fully realized her idea of
high-bred gentleness, that she need hardly have been so troubled by the
situation. She stole a glance at him as he stood by the chimney-piece,
in a thoughtful attitude, looking down at the burning logs on the
massive old andirons. The firelight shining on a face above it will
often give a sinister look to the openest countenance; and to-night
Lostwithiel's long, narrow face, dark, deep-set eyes, and pointed beard
had some touch of the diabolical in that red and uncertain glow; an
effect that was but instantaneous, for as the light changed the look
passed, and she saw him as he really was, with his pale and somewhat
sunken cheeks, and eyes darkly grave, of exceeding gentleness.</p>

<p>"Have you lived long at the Angler's Nest, Mrs. Disney?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nearly a year and a half; ever since my marriage, with just one
interval on the Continent before Martin went to India."</p>

<p>"Then I need not ask if you are heartily sick of the place?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should not be tired of the cottage or the neighbourhood if
my husband were at home. I am only tired of solitude. He wants me to
send for his sister&mdash;a girl who has not long left school&mdash;to keep me
company; but I detest school-girls, and I would much rather be alone
than put up with a silly companion."</p>

<p>"You are wise beyond your years, Mrs. Disney. Avoid the sister, by all
means. She would bore you to death&mdash;a scampering, exuberant girl, who
would develop hysteria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> after one month of Cornish dulness. Besides,
I am sure you have resources of your own, and that you would rather
endure solitude than uncongenial company."</p>

<p>Isola sighed, and shook her head rather dolefully, tracing the pattern
of the Persian rug with the point of her stick.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of books, and of music," she said; "but one gets tired
of being alone after a time. It seems such ages since Martin and I said
good-bye in Venice. I was dreadfully unhappy at first. I stand almost
alone in the world, when I am parted from him."</p>

<p>"Your father and mother are dead?" in gentlest inquiry.</p>

<p>"Oh no; they are not dead; they are at Dinan," she said, almost as if
it were the same thing.</p>

<p>"And that is very far from Trelasco."</p>

<p>"They never leave Dinan. The kind of life suits them. Mamma knits;
papa has his club and his English newspapers. People enjoy the English
papers so much more when they live abroad than when they are at home.
Mamma is a very bad sailor. It would be a risk for her to cross. If my
sister or I were dangerously ill, mamma would come. But it would be at
the hazard of her life. Papa has often told me so."</p>

<p>"And your father, is he a bad sailor?"</p>

<p>"He is rather worse than mamma."</p>

<p>"Then I conclude you were married at Dinan?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I never left Brittany until my wedding-day."</p>

<p>"What a pretty idea! It is as if Major Disney had found a new kind of
wild flower in some cranny of the old grey wall that guards the town."</p>

<p>"You know Dinan?"</p>

<p>"There are very few places within easy reach of a yachtsman that I
don't know. I have anchored in almost every bay between Cherbourg and
Brest, and have rambled inland whenever there was anything worth seeing
within a day's journey from the coast. Yes, I know Dinan well. Strange
to think that I may have passed you in the street there. Do you sketch,
by the way?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Ah, then, perhaps you are one of the young ladies I have seen sitting
at street corners, or under archways, doing fearful and wonderful
things with a box of moist colours and a drawing-board."</p>

<p>"The young ladies who sit about the streets are tourists," said Isola,
with a look of disgust.</p>

<p>"I understand. The resident ladies would no more do such things than
they would sit upon the pavement and make pictures of salmon or
men-of-war in coloured chalks, like our Metropolitan artists."</p>

<p>"I think I hear a carriage," said Isola, putting down her cup and
saucer, and looking at her jacket, which Mrs. Mayne was holding before
the fire.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the carriage," answered Lostwithiel, opening the glass
door. "What a night! The rain is just as bad as it was when I brought
you indoors."</p>

<p>"If you will accept the use of a shawl, ma'am, it would be safer than
putting on this damp jacket."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mayne, get your shawl. Mrs. Disney will wear it, I know."</p>

<p>The housekeeper bustled out, and Lostwithiel and his guest were alone,
looking at each other somewhat helplessly, as they stood far apart,
she in the glow of the hearth, he in the darkness near the door,
and feeling that every available subject of conversation had been
exhausted. Their embarrassment was increased when Dalton and a footman
came in with two great lamps and flooded the room with light.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to thank you for having taken so much trouble about
me," Isola faltered presently, under that necessity to say something
which is one of the marks of shyness.</p>

<p>"There has been no trouble. I only hope I got you out of that pelting
rain in time to save you from any evil consequences. Strange that our
acquaintance should begin in such an accidental manner. I shall be glad
to know more of Major Disney when he comes home, and in the meantime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
I hope I shall have the pleasure of meeting you sometimes. No doubt
you know everybody in the neighbourhood, so we can hardly help running
against each other somewhere."</p>

<p>Isola smiled faintly, thinking that the chances of any such meeting
were of the slightest; but she did not gainsay him. He wanted to say
something courteous no doubt, and had gone into no nice question of
probabilities before he spoke. She had heard him described by a good
many people, who had hinted darkly at his shortcomings, but had all
agreed as to his politeness and persuasive powers.</p>

<p>"A man who would talk over Satan himself," said the village lawyer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayne reappeared with a comfortable Scotch plaid, which she
wrapped carefully about Mrs. Disney, in a pleasant, motherly fashion.
The rain had all been shaken off the little felt hat, which had no
feathers or frippery to spoil. People who live in the west of England
make their account with wet weather.</p>

<p>Lord Lostwithiel handed his guest into the carriage, and stood
bareheaded in the rain to wish her good-bye before he shut the door.</p>

<p>"I shall be very anxious to know that you have escaped cold," he said,
at the last moment. "I hope you won't think me a nuisance if I call
to-morrow to inquire."</p>

<p>He shut the door quickly, and the brougham drove off before she
could answer. She was alone in the darkness in the snug, warm little
carriage. There was a clock ticking beside her, a sound that startled
her in the stillness. There was a basket hanging in front of her, and
an odour of cigars and Russia leather. There was a black bear rug,
lined with white fleeciness, which almost filled the carriage. She
had never sat in such a carriage. How different from the mouldy old
brougham in which she occasionally went to dinner-parties&mdash;a capacious
vehicle with a bow window, like a seaside parlour!</p>

<p>She leant back in a corner of the little carriage, wrapped in the soft,
warm rug, wondering at her strange adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> She had penetrated that
mysterious house on Black-fir Hill, and she had made the acquaintance
of Lord Lostwithiel. How much she would have to tell Martin in her next
letter! She wrote to him every week&mdash;a long, loving letter, closely
written on thin paper, pouring out all her fancies and feelings to the
husband she loved with all her heart.</p>

<p>She sighed as her thoughts recurred to the letter received to-day. Six
months, or perhaps even a year, before he was to come back to her! Yet
the letter had not been without hopefulness. He had the prospect of
getting his next step before that year was over, and then his coming
home would be a final return. He would be able to retire, and he would
buy some land&mdash;a hundred acres or so&mdash;and breed horses&mdash;one of his
youthful dreams&mdash;and do a little building, perhaps, to enlarge and
beautify the Angler's Nest, and his Isola should have a pair of ponies
and a good saddle-horse. He looked forward to a life of unalloyed
happiness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></p>

<p class="center">"BUT THE DAYS DROP ONE BY ONE."</p>


<p>Next morning was fine, a morning so bright and balmy that the month
might have been mistaken for September. Isola ran down to the garden in
her neat little morning frock and linen collar, and ran about among the
shrubs and autumn flowers in a much gayer mood than that of yesterday.
She loved her garden&mdash;small and modest as it was in comparison with the
grounds and gardens of her county neighbours&mdash;and on a morning like
this it was rapture to her to run from flower to flower, and from shrub
to shrub, with her great garden scissors in her hand, and her garden
basket hanging over her arm, clipping a withered leaf or a fading
flower every here and there, or plucking up those little groundsel
plants which seem the perpetual expression of the earth's fertility.</p>

<p>Alas! those pale tea-roses, those sulphur and flame-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>coloured dahlias,
meant the last crumbs of summer's plenteous feast. Soon winter and
barrenness would spread over the poor little garden; but even in the
chill dark heart of mid-winter those graceful conifers and shining
laurels, the vermilion on the holly bushes, the crimson of the hawthorn
berries would give beauty to the scene; and then would come the return
of Persephone with her hands full of gold, the abundant gold of crocus
and daffodil, jonquil and pale primrose, the rain of yellow blossoms
which heralds the spring.</p>

<p>Half a year did not seem such an appalling interval&mdash;nay, even the
thought of a year of waiting did not scare her so much this morning in
the sunlight and fresh clear air as yesterday in the grey dim rain.
What an improvement Martin would find in the garden, should he return
before the end of the summer! How tall those Irish yews had grown by
the gate yonder, a pair of dark green obelisks keeping stately guard
over the modest wooden gate; and the escalonia hedge that screened the
kitchen garden was two feet higher since the spring! How the juniper
at the corner of the grass plot had shot up and thickened! Arbutus,
laurel, ribes, everything had been growing as shrubs only grow in the
south and south-west of England. What a darling garden it was, and how
full of pleasure her life would be by-and-by, when Martin was able to
settle down and buy land, and give her a little herd of Jersey cows!
She had always envied the farmers' wives in that fertile valley of
the Rance, where her childhood had been passed. And how delightful to
have her own cows and her own farmyard, and a pony-carriage to drive
up and down the hilly Cornish lanes and into the narrow little street
of Fowey, and to ride her own horse by her husband's side for long
exploring rambles among those wild hills towards Mevagissey!</p>

<p>She had only to wait patiently for a year or less, and that bright
life might be hers. She had no frivolous vanities, no craving for
dissipations and fine clothes, no fatal thirst for "smartness." Her
ideas were essentially modest. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> never envied her sister, who
had married a rich stockbroker, and whose brand new red-brick house in
Hans Place towered above surrounding Chelsea as much as her diamonds
eclipsed the jewels of other middle-class matrons at the festal
gatherings of South Kensington and Bayswater. Gwendolen had married for
wealth. Isola had married for love. She had given her girlish affection
to a man who was nearly thirty years her senior, her heart going out to
him almost at the beginning of their acquaintance, first because he was
a soldier, and in her mind a hero, and secondly because he was kinder
to her than anybody else had ever been.</p>

<p>He was her first admirer. That delicate loveliness, as of some woodland
flower, which distinguished Isola from the herd of women, had been
still in embryo when Major Disney spent a summer holiday between Dinard
and Dinan. She had scarcely ranked as a pretty girl two years ago. The
slight figure was denounced as scraggy; the pale face was voted sickly;
and the delicate features were spoken of as insignificant. Gwendolen's
big fair face, with its healthy roses and lilies, her bright hair, and
well-developed figure, had completely overshadowed the younger sister.
Martin Disney was the first man upon whom Isola's low-toned beauty had
any power. He was drawn to her from the very beginning. She listened so
prettily, with such a bewitching modesty and almost tremulous pleasure,
when he talked to her, as they sat side by side on the club ground at
Dinard, watching Gwendolen playing tennis, superb in striped flannel
of delicate pink and cream colour. He could hardly believe that those
two were sisters. Isola was so slim and fragile, of such an ethereal
prettiness, owing so little to colouring, and nothing to redundancy of
form.</p>

<p>He was told that Miss Manwaring was engaged to one of the richest
men in London. That, of course, was a gossip's fable, but it was an
established fact that Mr. Hazelrigg had made his fortune in South
American railways, water-works, and other public improvements, and
could afford to make a liberal settlement.</p>

<p>He showed no indisposition to be generous to his handsome sweetheart.
He settled seven hundred a year upon her, and told her that she could
spend as much of that income as she liked upon toilet and pocket-money,
and that he would invest her surplus advantageously for her.</p>

<p>The two sisters were married on the same day to husbands who were their
seniors by more than twenty years in one instance, by thirty years in
the other. Daniel Hazelrigg had passed his jubilee birthday when he led
Miss Manwaring to the altar; but he was a fine-looking man, straight
and tall, like his bride, with a ruddy complexion and iron-grey
moustache, and an air and bearing that savoured rather of the mess-room
than the city. He had been on the Stock Exchange ever since he came
of age; but he had made it the study of his life not to look city or
to talk city. Nothing could tempt him to expatiate upon the money
market outside his office. He would talk sport, travel, politics&mdash;even
literature, of which he knew very little&mdash;but not stocks and shares,
Nicaraguas, or Reading and Philadelphias, Mexican Street Railways, or
Patagonian Building Society.</p>

<p>Isola read her sister's glowing descriptions of dinners and routs,
gowns by Worth or Cresser, suppers for two hundred people at a guinea
a head, from Gunter, waggon-loads of cut roses from Cheshunt or Cheam,
and felt no thrill of longing, no pang of envy. Life in the Angler's
Nest might be dull; but it was only dull because Martin was away.
She would have felt more solitary in Hans Place, had she accepted
Gwendolen's invitation to spend her Christmas there, than she would
feel in the cottage by the river, even with no better company than
Tabitha, Shah, and Tim. She was essentially shy and retiring. Her
girlhood had been spent in a very narrow world, among people whom she
seemed to have known all her life; for while Gwendolen, who was six
years older, and had been "out" for four years before she married,
joined in all the little gaieties of the place, and was always making
new acquaintance, Isola, who was not "out," spent her days for the most
part in a half-neglected garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> on the slope of the hill that looks
across the Rance towards the unseen sea. The view from that garden was
one of the finest in Western France; and it was Isola's delight to sit
in a little berceau at the end of a terrace walk, with her books and
work-basket and drawing-board, all through the long tranquil summer
day, in a silence broken by the sound of wheels and horses' feet on the
viaduct and bridge two or three hundred feet below, or by the muffled
music of the organ in the convent chapel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tim, the fox-terrier, and Shah, the Persian cat, were both on the
lawn with their mistress this morning. They were not friendly towards
each other, but preserved an armed neutrality. Tim chased every stray
strange cat with a fury that threatened annihilation; and he always
looked as if he would like to give chase to Shah, when that dignified
piece of fluff moved slowly across the lawn before him with uplifted
tail that seemed to wave defiance; but he knew that any attack upon
that valued personage would entail punishment and disgrace. Isola loved
both these animals&mdash;the cat a wedding-present from an old Breton lady
in Dinan, the terrier her husband's parting legacy. "Take care of Tim,"
he had said, the day they parted on board the steamer at Venice.</p>

<p>The dog loved his mistress vehemently and obtrusively, leaping into
her lap at the slightest sign of indulgence in her eye. The cat
suffered himself to be adored, receiving all attentions with a sleepy
complacency.</p>

<p>It was only half-past eight, and the world was looking its freshest.
There was an opening in the shrubbery that let in a view of the river,
and just in front of this opening there was a rustic bench on which
Major Disney liked to smoke his after-breakfast pipe or after-dinner
cigar. The garden contained very little over two acres, but it was
an old garden, and there were some fine old trees, which must have
shaded hoops and powder, and pig-tails and knee-breeches. Major Disney
had done a great deal in the way of planting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> wherever there was room
for improvement, and he had secured to himself an elderly gardener
of exceptional industry, who worked in the garden as if he loved it.
Tabitha, again, was one of those wonderful women who know all about
everything except books; and she, too, loved the garden, and helped
at weeding and watering, in seasons of pressure. Thus it had come to
pass that these two acres of velvet lawn and flower-bed, shrubbery, and
trim, old-fashioned garden had acquired a reputation in Trelasco, and
people frequently complimented Mrs. Disney about her garden.</p>

<p>She was proud of their praises, remembering the straggling rose-bushes
and lavender, and unkempt flower-beds, and overgrown cabbages, and
loose shingly paths in that old garden at Dinan, which she had loved
despite its neglected condition. Her house at Trelasco was just
as superior to the house at Dinan, as garden was to garden. She
often thought of her old home, the shabby square house, with walls
and shutters of dazzling white, shining brown floors, and worn-out
furniture of the Empire period, furniture which had been shabby and out
of repair when Colonel Manwaring took the house furnished, intending
to spend a month or two in retirement at Dinan with his wife and her
firstborn, a chubby little girl of five. They had lost a promising boy
of a year old, and the colonel, having no reason for living anywhere
in particular, and very little to live upon, thought that residence
in a foreign country would improve his wife's health and spirits. He
had been told that Dinan was picturesque and cheap: and he had put
himself and his family on board the <i>St. Malo</i> steamer and had gone out
like an emigrant to push his fortunes in a strange land. He had even
an idea that he might get "something to do" in Dinan&mdash;a secretaryship
of a club, an agency, or managerial post of some kind, never having
cultivated the art of self-examination so far as to discover that he
must have proved utterly incapable, had any such occasion presented
itself.</p>

<p>Tho occasion never did present itself. The one English club existent
at Dinan in those days was amply provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> with the secretarial
element. There was nothing in Dinan for an Englishman to manage; no
English agency required. Colonel Manwaring settled down into a kind
of somnolent submission to obscure fortunes. He liked the old town,
and he liked the climate. He liked the cooking, and he liked being
out of the way of all the people he knew, and whose vicinity would
have obliged him to live up to a certain conventional level. He liked
to get his English newspapers upon French soil, and it irked him not
that they were thirty-six hours old. He liked to bask in the sunshine
on the terrace above the Rance, or in the open places of the town. He
liked talking of the possibilities of an impending war, in very dubious
French, with the French officers, whose acquaintance he made at club
or café. He had sold his commission and sunk the proceeds of the sale
upon an annuity. He had a little income of his own, and his wife had
a little money from a maiden aunt, and these resources just enabled
him to live with a certain unpretending comfort. He had a good Breton
cook, and an old Scotch valet and butler, who would have gone through
fire and water for his master. Mrs. Manwaring was a thoroughly negative
character, placid as summer seas, sympathetic and helpless. She let
Macgregor and Antoinette manage the house for her, do all the catering,
pay all the bills, and work the whole machinery of her domestic life.
She rejoiced in having a good-tempered husband and obedient daughters.
She had no boys to put her in a fever of anxiety lest they should be
making surreptitious ascents in balloons or staking their little all
upon Zero at the "Etablissement" at Dinard. In summer she sat all day
in one particular south window, knitting stockings for the colonel
and reading the English papers. In winter she occupied herself in the
same manner by the chimney corner. She devoted one day in the week
to writing long letters to distant relatives. Once a day, weather
permitting, she took a gentle constitutional walk upon the terrace
above the Rance, with one of her daughters. Needless to say that in
this life of harmless apathy she had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> very stout, and that she
had forgotten almost every accomplishment of her girlhood.</p>

<p>From the placid monotony of life in Brittany to the placid monotony of
life in Cornwall, was not a startling transition; yet when she married
Martin Disney, and bade her commonplace father and her apathetic mother
good-bye, Isola felt as if she had escaped from stagnation into a fresh
and vigorous atmosphere. Disney's character made all the difference.
He was every inch a soldier, a keen politician, a man who had seen
many countries and read many books, clear-brained, strong-willed,
energetic, self-reliant. She felt what it was to belong to somebody
who was capable of taking care of her. She trusted him implicitly; and
she loved him with as deep a love as a girl of nineteen is capable of
feeling for any lover. It may be that the capacity for deep feeling
is but half developed at that age, and in that one fact may be found
the key to many domestic mysteries; mysteries of unions which begin
in the gladness and warmth of responsive affection, and which, a few
years later, pass into a frozen region of indifference or are wrecked
on sunken rocks of guilty passion. Certain it was that Isola Manwaring
gave her hand to this grave, middle-aged soldier, in all the innocence
of a first love; and the love with which he rewarded her confidence,
the earnest watchful love of a man of mature years, was enough for her
happiness. That honeymoon time, that summer of installation in the
Cornish cottage, and then the leisurely journey to Venice in the waning
brilliance of a southern October, seemed like one long happy dream, as
she looked back upon it now, after a year of solitude.</p>

<p>The doctor had decided that, in the delicate health in which she found
herself at the end of that summer, it would be dangerous for her to
accompany her husband to India, more especially as a campaign in Burmah
meant roughing it, and she would in all probability have been separated
from him in the East; so they bade each other a sad good-bye at Venice,
and Isola travelled quickly homeward, all possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> comfort having been
secured for her on the way, by her husband's forethought. It had been
a long, sad, sleepy journey, through a rain-blurred landscape, and she
was glad when the evening of the fourth day brought her to the snug
little dining-room in the Angler's Nest, where Tabitha was waiting
for her with a cheerful fire and the amber-shaded reading lamp, and
the most delightful little composite meal of chicken and tongue, and
tart, and cream, and tea. It was pleasant to be among familiar things,
after that long journey in stuffy ladies' carriages, with elderly
invalids, whose chief talk was of their ailments. Pleasant to see the
Shah's solemn sea-green eyes staring at her, and to have to repulse the
demonstrative attentions of Tim, who leapt upon her lap and licked her
face vehemently every time he caught her off her guard.</p>

<p>She was ill and broken down after her journey, and that sad parting,
and she hid her tears upon Tabitha's comfortable arm.</p>

<p>"It will be at least a year before he comes back," she sobbed. "How can
I live without him all that dreary time?"</p>

<p>Tabitha thought it was very hard upon the girl-wife, but affected to
make light of it. "Lor, bless you, ma'am," she said, "a year looks a
long time, but it isn't much when you come to grapple with it. There'll
be such a lot for you to do. There'll be the garden. We ought to make
ever so many improvements next spring and summer, against the master
comes home. And there's your piano. You want to improve yourself&mdash;I've
heard you say so&mdash;and you can get up all sorts of new tunes, and won't
the major be pleased with you; and then&mdash;there'll be something else to
occupy your mind before next summer comes."</p>

<p>That "something else" which was to have filled Isola's empty life
with a new interest, ended in disappointment. She was very ill at
the beginning of the new year, and Tabitha nursed her with motherly
tenderness long after the doctor and the professional nurse had
renounced their care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> of her. She regained strength very slowly after
that serious illness, and it was only in June that she was able to take
the lonely rambles she loved, or row in her little boat upon the river.</p>

<p>Tabitha was a servant in a thousand, faithful and devoted, clever,
active, and industrious. She had been maid to Martin Disney's mother
for nearly fifteen years, had nursed her mistress through a long and
weary illness, and had closed her eyes in death. Martin parted with
that faithful servant with reluctance after the breaking up of his
mother's household, and he told her if he should marry and have a house
of his own&mdash;a very remote contingency&mdash;she must be his housekeeper.
Love and marriage came upon him before the end of the year, as a
delightful surprise. He bought the Angler's Nest, and he engaged
Tabitha for the rest of her life, at wages which, beginning at a
liberal figure, were to rise a pound every Christmas.</p>

<p>"As if I cared about wages, Mr. Martin," exclaimed Tabitha. "I'd just
as soon come to you for nothing. I've got more clothes than will last
my time, I'll be bound. You'd only have to find me in shoe-leather."</p>

<p>She had never got out of the way of calling her master by the name
by which she had first known him, when his father and elder brother
were both at home, in the old family house at Fowey. In all moments of
forgetfulness he was still "Mr. Martin."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, in this bright November morning, Tabitha came out to say
that breakfast was waiting for her young mistress, and mistress and
maid went in together to the cosy dining-room, where the small round
table near the window was arranged as only Tabitha could arrange a
table&mdash;with autumn flowers, and spotless damask, and a new-laid egg,
and a dish of honey, and some dainty little rolls of Tabitha's own
making, nestling in a napkin, a breakfast for a Princess in a fairy
tale.</p>

<p>There was only one other servant in the little household&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>a bouncing,
rosy-cheeked Cornish girl, who was very industrious under Tabitha's
eye, and very idle when she was out of that faithful housekeeper's
ken. Tabitha cooked and took care of everything, and for the most part
waited upon her mistress in this time of widowhood, although Susan was
supposed to be parlour-maid.</p>

<p>Tabitha poured out the tea, and buttered a roll, while Isola leant back
in the bamboo chair and played with the Shah.</p>

<p>"I never knew him do such a thing before," said Tabitha, in
continuation of a theme which had been fully discussed last night.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was very kind and polite; but it was not such a tremendous
thing, after all," answered Isola, still occupied with the Persian. "He
could hardly stand by and see one drowned. You have no idea what the
rain was like."</p>

<p>"But to send you home in his own carriage."</p>

<p>"There was nothing else for him to do&mdash;except send me home in the
gardener's cart. He could not have turned out a dog in such weather."</p>

<p>"It's a thing that never happened before, and it just shows what a
respect he must have for the Disneys. You don't know how stand-offish
he is with all the people about here&mdash;how he keeps himself to himself.
Not a bit like his father and mother. They used to entertain all the
neighbourhood, and they went everywhere, as affable as you like. He has
taken care to show people that he doesn't want their company. They say
he has led a very queer kind of life at home and abroad; never settling
down anywhere, here to-day and gone to-morrow; roving about with his
yacht. I don't believe any good ever comes of a young gentleman like
that having a yacht. It would be ever so much better for him to live at
the Mount and keep a pack of harriers."</p>

<p>"Why should a yacht be bad?" asked Isola, lazily beginning her
breakfast, Tabitha standing by the table all the time, ready for
conversation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. It gives a young man too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> liberty," answered
Tabitha, shaking her head with a meaning air, as if with a knowledge of
dark things in connection with yachts. "He can keep just what company
he likes on board&mdash;gentlemen or ladies. He can gamble&mdash;or drink&mdash;as
much as he likes. There's nobody to check him. Sundays and weekdays,
night and day, are all alike to him."</p>

<p>"Lord Lostwithiel is not particularly young," said Isola, musingly, not
paying much attention to this homily on yachts. "He must be thirty, I
think."</p>

<p>"Thirty-two last birthday. He ought to marry and settle down. They say
he's very clever, and that he's bound to make a figure in politics some
of these odd days."</p>

<p>Isola looked at the clock on the chimney-piece&mdash;a gilt horse-shoe
with onyx nails; one of her wedding presents. It was early yet&mdash;only
half-past nine. Lord Lostwithiel had talked about calling to inquire
after her health. She felt overpowered with shyness at the thought of
seeing him again, alone&mdash;with no stately Mrs. Mayne to take the edge
off a <i>tête-à-tête</i>. Anything to escape such an ordeal! There was her
boat&mdash;that boat of which she was perfect mistress, and in which she
went for long, dawdling expeditions towards Fowey or Lostwithiel with
only Tim for her companion&mdash;Tim, who was the best of company, in almost
perpetual circulation between stem and stern, balancing himself in
perilous places every now and then, to bark furiously at imaginary foes
in slowly passing fishermen's boats.</p>

<p>"Have you any fancy about lunch, ma'am?" asked Tabitha, lingering with
feather-brush in hand over a side-table, on which work-basket, books,
writing-case, and flower-vases were arranged with tasteful neatness by
those skilful hands.</p>

<p>"No, you dear old Tabbie; you know that anything will do for me. Bread
and jam, if you like, and some of your clotted cream. Won't it be nice
when we have our very own dairy, and our very own cows, who will know
us and be fond of us, like Tim and the Shah?"</p>

<p>She put on her hat and jacket, and went out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> garden again,
singing "La Lettre de Perichole" as she went. It was a capital idea
to take refuge in her boat. If his lordship should call&mdash;which was
doubtful&mdash;since he might be one of that numerous race of people
whose days are made up of unfulfilled intentions and promises never
realized&mdash;if he should call, she would be far away when he came. He
would make his inquiry, leave his card, which would look nice in the
old Indian bowl on the hall-table. Such cards have a power of flotation
unknown to other pasteboard; they are always at the top.</p>

<p>Isola went to the little boat-house on the edge of the lawn, Tim
following her. She pushed the light skiff down the slope into the
water, and in a few minutes more her sculls were in the rowlocks and
she was moving slowly up the river, between autumnal woods, in a
silence broken only by the dip of the sculls and the little rippling
sound as the water dropped away from them. A good deal of her life
was spent like this, moving slowly up the river through that deep
silence of the woodland shores. The river was as beautiful as the Dart
almost, but lonelier and more silent. It was Martin Disney's river&mdash;the
river whose ripples had soothed his mother's dying ears&mdash;the last
of all earthly sounds that had been heard in the stillness of the
death-chamber.</p>

<p>In that tranquil atmosphere Isola used to dream of her absent husband
and of that mystical world of the East which seemed made up of
dreams&mdash;the world of Brahma and Buddha, of jewel-bedecked Rajahs and
Palace-tombs&mdash;world of beauty and of terror; of tropical forests,
tigers, orchids, serpents, elephants, Thugs.</p>

<p>She dreamt her dream of that strange world in fear and trembling,
conjuring up scenes of horror&mdash;tiger hunts; snakes hidden in the corner
of a tent; battle; fever; fire; mutiny. Her morbid imagination pictured
all possible and impossible danger for the man she loved. And then she
thought of his home-coming&mdash;for good, for good&mdash;for all the span of
their joint lives; and she longed for that return with the sickness of
hope deferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>She would go back to the Angler's Nest sometimes after one of these
dreamy days upon the river, and would pace about the house or the
garden, planning things for her husband's return, as if he were due
next day. She would wheel his own particular chair to the drawing-room
fireplace, and look at it, and arrange the fall of the curtains before
the old-fashioned bow-window, and change the position of the lamp,
and alter the books on the shelves, and do this and that with an eye
to effect, anxious to discover how the room might be made prettiest,
cosiest, most lovable and home-like&mdash;for him, for him, for him!</p>

<p>And now she had to resign herself to a year's delay, perhaps. Yes,
he had said it might be a year. All that bright picture of union and
content, which had seemed so vivid and so near, had now grown dim and
pale. It had melted into a shadowy distance. To a girl who has but just
passed her twentieth birthday a year of waiting and delay seems an
eternity.</p>

<p>"I won't think of him," she said to herself, plunging her sculls
fiercely into the rippling water. The tide was running down, and it was
strong enough to have carried her little boat out to sea like an autumn
leaf swept along the current. "I must try to lull my mind to sleep, as
if I were an enchanted Princess, and so bridge over twelve slow months
of loneliness. I won't think of you, Martin, my good, brave, truest of
the true! I'll occupy my poor, foolish little mind. I'll write a novel,
perhaps, like old Miss Carver at Dinan. Anything in the world&mdash;just to
keep my thoughts from always brooding on one subject."</p>

<p>She rowed on steadily, hugging the shore under the wooded hillside,
where the rich autumn colouring and the clear, cool lights were so full
of beauty&mdash;a beauty which she could feel, with a vague, dim sense which
just touched the realm of poetry. Perhaps she felt the same sense of
loss which Keats or Alfred de Musset would have felt in the stillness
of such a scene&mdash;the want of something to people the wood and the
river&mdash;some race of beings loftier than fishermen and peasants; some of
those mystic forms which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> the poet sees amidst the shadows of old woods
or in the creeks and sheltered inlets of a secluded river.</p>

<p>She thought, with a half-smile, of yesterday's adventure. What
importance that foolish Tabitha gave to so simple an incident; the
merest commonplace courtesy, necessitated by circumstances; and
only because the person who had been commonly courteous was Richard
Hulbert, thirteenth Baron Lostwithiel. Thirteenth Baron! There lay
the distinction. These Cornish folks worshipped antique lineage.
Tabitha would have thought very little of a mushroom peer's civility,
although he had sent her mistress home in a chariot and four. She was
no worshipper of wealth, and she turned up her blunt old nose at Mr.
Crowther, of Glenaveril&mdash;the great new red-brick mansion which had
sprung up like a fungus amidst the woods only yesterday&mdash;because he had
made his money in trade, albeit his trade had been upon a large scale,
and altogether genteel and worthy to be esteemed&mdash;a great cloth factory
at Stroud, which was said to have clad half the army at one period of
modern history.</p>

<p>Poor, foolish Tabitha! What would she have thought of the tea-drinking
in that lovely old room, mysteriously beautiful in the light of a
wood fire&mdash;the playful, uncertain light which glorifies everything?
What would she have thought of those walls of books&mdash;richly bound
books, books in sombre brown, big books and little books, from floor
to ceiling? A room which made those poor little oak bookcases in the
cottage parlour something to blush for. What would Tabitha have thought
of his deferential kindness&mdash;that tone of deepest consideration with
which such men treat all women, even the old and uncomely? She could
hardly have helped admiring his good manners, whatever dark things she
might have been told about his earlier years.</p>

<p>Why should he not have a yacht? It seemed the fittest life for a man
without home ties; a man still young, and with no need to labour at a
profession. What better life could there be than that free wandering
from port to port over a romantic sea?&mdash;and to Isola all seas were
alike mysterious and romantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>She dawdled away the morning; she sculled against the stream for nearly
three hours, and then let her boat drift down the river to the garden
above the towpath. It was long past her usual time for luncheon when
she moored her boat to the little wooden steps, leaving it for Thomas,
the gardener, to pull up into the boat-house. She had made up her mind
that if Lostwithiel troubled himself to make any inquiry about her
health he would call in the morning.</p>

<p>She had guessed rightly. Tabitha was full of his visit, and his
wondrous condescension. He had called at eleven o'clock, on his way
to the railway station at Fowey. He called in the most perfect of T
carts, with a pair of bright bays. Tabitha had opened the door to him.
He had asked quite anxiously about Mrs. Disney's health. He had walked
round the garden with Tabitha and admired everything, and had told
her that Major Disney had a better gardener than any he had at the
Mount, after which he had left her charmed by his amiability. And so
this little episode in Isola's life came to a pleasant end, leaving no
record but his lordship's card, lying like a jewel on the top of less
distinguished names in the old Indian bowl.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></p>

<p class="center">"OH MOMENT ONE AND INFINITE!"</p>


<p>Isola fancied that her adventure was all over and done with after
that ceremonious call of inquiry; but in so narrow a world as that of
Trelasco it was scarcely possible to have seen the last of a man who
lived within three miles; and she and Lord Lostwithiel met now and then
in the course of her solitary rambles. The walk into Fowey, following
the old disused railway, was almost her favourite, and one which she
had occasion to take oftener than any other, since Tabitha was a
stay-at-home person, and expected her young mistress to do all the
marketing, so that Isola had usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> some errand to take her into the
narrow street on the hillside above the sea. It was at Fowey that she
oftenest met Lostwithiel. His yacht, the <i>Vendetta</i>, was in the harbour
under repairs, and he went down to look at the work daily, and often
dawdled upon the deck till dusk, watching the carpenters, or talking
to his captain. They had been half over the world together, master
and man, and were almost as familiar as brothers. The crew were half
English and half foreign; and it was a curious mixture of languages in
which Lostwithiel talked to them. They were most of them old hands on
board the <i>Vendetta</i>, and would have stood by the owner of the craft if
he had wanted to sail her up the Phlegethon.</p>

<p>She was a schooner of two hundred and fifty tons, built for speed, and
with a rakish rig. She had cost, with her fittings, her extra silk
sails for racing, more money than Lostwithiel cared to remember; but
he loved her as a man loves his mistress, and if she were costly and
exacting, she was no worse than other mistresses, and she was true as
steel, which they are not always; and so he felt that he had money's
worth in her. He showed her to Isola one evening from the promontory
above the harbour, where she met him in the autumn sundown. Her work at
the butcher's and the grocer's being done, she had gone up to that airy
height by Point Neptune to refresh herself with a long look seaward
before she went back to her home in the valley. Lostwithiel took her
away from the Point, and made her look down into the harbour.</p>

<p>"Isn't she a beauty?" he asked, pointing below.</p>

<p>Her inexperienced eyes roamed about among the boats, colliers,
fishing-boats, half a dozen yachts of different tonnage.</p>

<p>"Which is yours?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Which? Why, there is only one decent boat in the harbour. The
schooner."</p>

<p>She saw which boat he meant by the direction in which he flourished
his walking-stick, but was not learned in distinc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>tions of rig. The
<i>Vendetta</i>, being under repair, did not seem to her especially lovely.</p>

<p>"Have you pretty cabins?" she asked childishly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they're pretty enough; but that's not the question. Look
at her lines. She skims over the water like a gull. Ladies seem to
think only what a boat looks like inside. I believe my boat is rather
exceptional, from a lady's point of view. Will you come on board and
have a look at her?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, no; I couldn't possibly. It will be dark before I get home as
it is."</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't take you a quarter of an hour, and we could row you up
the river in no time&mdash;ever so much faster than you could walk."</p>

<p>Isola looked frightened at the very idea.</p>

<p>"Not for the world!" she said. "Tabitha would think I had gone mad. She
would begin to fancy that I could never go out without over-staying the
daylight, and troubling you to send me home."</p>

<p>"Ah, but it is so long since you were last belated," he said, in his
low caressing voice, with a tone that was new to her and different from
all other voices; "ages and ages ago&mdash;half a lifetime. There could be
no harm in being just a little late this mild evening, and I would row
you home&mdash;myself, under the new moon. Look at her swinging up in the
grey blue there above Polruan. She looks like a fairy boat, anchored in
the sky by that star hanging a fathom below her keel. I look at her,
and wish&mdash;wish&mdash;wish!"</p>

<p>He looked up, pale in the twilight, with dark deep-set eyes, of which
it was never easy to read the expression. Perhaps that inscrutable
look made those sunken and by no means brilliant eyes more interesting
than some much handsomer eyes&mdash;interesting with the deep interest that
belongs to the unknowable.</p>

<p>"Good night," said Isola. "I'm afraid that I shall be very late."</p>

<p>"Good night. You would be earlier if you would trust to the boat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>He held out his hand, and she gave him hers, hesitatingly for the first
time in their acquaintance. It was after this parting in the wintry
sundown that she first began to look troubled at meeting him.</p>

<p>The troubled feeling grew upon her somehow. In a life so lonely and
uneventful trifles assume undue importance. She tried to avoid him,
and on her journeys to Fowey she finished her business in the village
street and turned homewards without having climbed the promontory by
that rugged walk she loved so well. It needed some self-denial to
forego that keen pleasure of standing on the windy height and gazing
across the western sea towards Ushant and her native province; but she
knew that Lord Lostwithiel spent a good deal of his time lounging on
the heights above the harbour, and she did not want to meet him again.</p>

<p>Although she lived her quiet life in the shortening days for nearly a
month without meeting him, she was not allowed to forget his existence.
Wherever she went people talked about him and speculated about him.
Every detail of his existence made matter for discussion; his yacht,
his political opinions, his talents, his income, his matrimonial
prospects, the likelihood or unlikelihood of his settling down
permanently at the Mount, and taking the hounds, which were probably to
be without a master within a measurable distance of time. There was so
little to talk about in Trelasco and those scattered hamlets between
Fowey and Lostwithiel.</p>

<p>Isola found herself joining in the talk at afternoon tea-parties, those
casual droppings in of charitable ladies who had been their rounds
among the cottagers and came back to the atmosphere of gentility worn
out by long stories of woes and ailments, sore legs and rheumatic
joints, and were very glad to discuss a local nobleman over a cup
of delicately flavoured Indian tea in the glow of a flower-scented
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Among other houses Mrs. Disney visited Glenaveril, Mr. Crowther's great
red-brick mansion, with its pepper-box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> turrets, and Jacobean windows,
after the manner of Burleigh House by Stamford town.</p>

<p>Here lived in wealth and state quite the most important family within a
mile of Trelasco, the Vansittart Crowthers, erst of Pilbury Mills, near
Stroud, now as much county as a family can make itself after its head
has passed his fortieth birthday. Nobody quite knew how Mr. Crowther
had come to be a Vansittart&mdash;unless by the easy process of baptism and
the complaisance of an aristocratic sponsor; but the Crowthers had been
known in Stroud for nearly two hundred years, and had kept their sacks
upright, as Mr. Crowther called it, all that time.</p>

<p>Fortune had favoured this last of the Crowthers, and, at forty years
of age, he had found himself rich enough to dispose of his business
to two younger brothers and a brother-in-law, and to convert himself
into a landed proprietor. He bought up all the land that was to be had
about Trelasco. Cornish people cling to their land like limpets to a
rock; and it was not easy to acquire the ownership of the soil. In the
prosperous past, when land was paying nearly four per cent. in other
parts of England, Cornishmen were content to hold estates that yielded
only two per cent.; but the days of decay had come when Mr. Crowther
entered the market, and he was able to buy out more than one gentleman
of ancient lineage.</p>

<p>When he had secured his land, he sent to Plymouth for an architect, and
he so harried that architect and so tampered with his drawings that
the result of much labour and outlay was that monstrosity in red brick
with stone dressings, known in the neighbourhood as Glenaveril. Mr.
Crowther's elder daughter was deep in Lord Lytton's newly published
poem when the house was being finished, and had imposed that euphonious
name upon her father. Glenaveril. The house really was in a glen,
or at least in a wooded valley, and Glenaveril seemed to suit it to
perfection; and so the romantic name of a romantic poem was cut in
massive Gothic letters on the granite pillars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> Vansittart Crowther's
gate, beneath a shield which exhibited the coat of arms made and
provided by the Herald's College.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vansittart Crowther was at home on Thursday afternoons, when the
choicest Indian tea and the thickest cream, coffee as in Paris, and
the daintiest cakes and muffins which a professed cook could provide,
furnished the zest to conversation; for it could scarcely be said that
the conversation gave a zest to those creature comforts. It would be
perhaps nearer the mark to say that Mrs. Crowther was supposed to sit
in the drawing-room on these occasions while the two Miss Crowthers
were at home. The mistress of Glenaveril was not an aspiring woman; and
in her heart of hearts she preferred Gloucestershire to Cornwall, and
the stuccoed villa on the Cheltenham road, with its acre and a half
of tennis-lawn and flower-beds, open to the blazing sun, and powdered
with the summer dust, to Glenaveril, with its solemn belt of woodlands,
and its too spacious grandeur. She was not vulgar or illiterate. She
never misplaced an aspirate. She had learnt to play the piano and to
talk French at the politest of young ladies' schools at Cheltenham.
She never dressed outrageously, or behaved rudely. She had neither red
hands nor splay feet. She was in all things blameless; and yet Belinda
and Alicia, her daughters, were ashamed of her, and did their utmost
to keep her, and her tastes, and her opinions in the background. She
had no style. She was not "smart." She seemed incapable of grasping
the ideas, or understanding the ways of smart people; or at least her
daughters thought so.</p>

<p>"Your mother is one of the best women I know," said the curate to
Alicia, being on the most confidential terms with both sisters, "and
yet you and Miss Crowther are always trying to edit her."</p>

<p>"Father wants a great deal more editing than mother," said Belinda,
"but there's no use in talking to him. He is encased in the armour
of self-esteem. It made my blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> run cold to see him taking Lord
Lostwithiel over the grounds and stables the other day&mdash;praising
everything, and pointing out this and that,&mdash;and even saying how much
things had cost!"</p>

<p>"I dare say it was vulgar," agreed the curate, "but it's human nature.
I've seen a duke behave in pretty much the same way. Children are
always proud of their new toys, and men are but children of a larger
growth, don't you know. You'll find there's a family resemblance in
humanity, and that nature is stronger than training."</p>

<p>"Lord Lostwithiel would never behave in that kind of way&mdash;boring people
about his stables."</p>

<p>"Lord Lostwithiel doesn't care about stables&mdash;he would bore you about
his yacht, I dare say."</p>

<p>"No, he never talks of himself or his own affairs. That is just the
charm of his manner. He makes us all believe that he is thinking about
us; and yet I dare say he forgets us directly he is outside the gate."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he does," replied Mr. Colfox, the curate. "There isn't a more
selfish man living than Lostwithiel."</p>

<p>The fair Belinda looked at him angrily. There are assertions which
young ladies make on purpose to have them controverted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Disney hated the great red-brick porch, with its vaulted roof and
monstrous iron lantern, and the bell which made such a clamour, as if
it meant fire, or at least dinner, when she touched the hanging brass
handle. She hated to find herself face to face with a tall footman,
who hardly condescended to say whether his mistress were at home or
not, but just preceded her languidly along the broad corridor, where
the carpet was so thick that it felt like turf, and flung open the
drawing-room door with an air, and pronounced her name into empty
space, so remote were the half-dozen ladies at the other end of the
room, clustered round Belinda's tea-table, and fed with cake by
Alicia, while Mrs. Crowther sat in the window a little way off, with
her basket of woolwork at her side, and her fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> somnolent pug lying
at her feet. To Isola it was an ordeal to have to walk the length
of the drawing-room, navigating her course amidst an archipelago of
expensive things&mdash;Florentine tables, portfolios of engravings, Louis
Seize Jardinières, easels supporting the last expensive etching
from Goupil's&mdash;to the window where Mrs. Crowther waited to receive
her, rising with her lap full of wools, to shake hands with simple
friendliness and without a vestige of style. Belinda shook hands
on a level with the tip of her sharp <i>retroussé</i> nose, and twirled
the silken train of her tea-gown with the serpentine grace of Sarah
Bernhardt. She prided herself on those serpentine movements and languid
graces which belong to the Græco-Belgravian period; while Alicia
held herself like a ramrod, and took her stand upon being nothing
if not sporting. Her olive-cloth gown and starched collar, her neat
double-soled boots and cloth gaiters, were a standing reproach to
Belinda's silken slovenliness and embroidered slippers, always dropping
off her restless feet, and being chased surreptitiously among her lace
and pongee frillings. Poor Mrs. Crowther disliked the Guard's collar,
which she felt was writing premature wrinkles upon her younger girl's
throat, but she positively loathed the loose elegance of the Indian
silk tea-gown, with its wide Oriental sleeves, exhibiting naked arms
to the broad daylight. That sloppy raiment made a discord in the
subdued harmony of the visitors' tailor-made gowns&mdash;well worn some of
them&mdash;brown, and grey, and indigo, and russet; and Mrs. Crowther was
tortured by the conviction that her elder daughter looked disreputable.
This honest matron was fond of Isola Disney. In her own simple
phraseology, she had "taken to her;" and pressed the girl-wife to come
every Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>"It must be so lonely for you," she said gently, "with your husband so
far away, and you such a child, too. I wonder your mamma doesn't come
and stay with you for a bit. You must always come on our Thursdays. Now
mind you do, my dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think our Thursdays are remarkably enlivening, mother," said
Alicia, objecting to the faintest suggestion of fussiness, the crying
sin of both her parents. And then she turned to Isola, and measured her
from head to foot. "It's rather a pity you don't hunt," she said. "We
had a splendid morning with the hounds."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may get a little hunting by-and-by, when my husband comes
home."</p>

<p>"Ah, but one can't begin all at once; and this is a difficult country;
breakneck hills, and nasty banks. Have you hunted much?"</p>

<p>"Hardly at all. I was out in a boar-hunt once, near Angers, but only as
a looker-on. It was a grand sight. The Duke of Beaufort came over to
Brittany on purpose to join in it."</p>

<p>"How glorious a boar-hunt must be! I must get my father to take me to
Angers next year. Do you know a great many people there?"</p>

<p>"No, only two or three professors at the college, and the Marquis de
Querangal, the gentleman who has the boar-hounds. His daughter used to
visit at Dinan, and she and I were great friends."</p>

<p>"Lord Lostwithiel talked about boar-hunting the other night," said
Alicia. "It must be capital fun." His name recurred in this way,
whatever the conversation might be, with more certainty than Zero on
the wheel at roulette.</p>

<p>He had been there in the evening, Isola thought. There had been a
dinner-party, perhaps, at which he had been present. She had not long
to wonder. The name once pronounced, the stream of talk flowed on. Yes,
there had been a dinner, and Lord Lostwithiel had been delightful; so
brilliant in conversation as compared with everybody else; so witty, so
cynical, so <i>fin de siècle</i>.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear him say anything very much out of the common," said Mrs.
Crowther, in her matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p>She liked having a nobleman or any other local magnate at her
table; but she had too much common sense to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> hypnotized by his
magnificence, and made to taste milk and water as Maronean wine.</p>

<p>"Do you know Lord Lostwithiel?" Belinda asked languidly, as Isola
sipped her tea, sitting shyly in the broad glare of a colossal
fireplace. "Oh yes, by-the-by, you met him here the week before last."</p>

<p>Mrs. Disney blushed to the roots of those soft tendril-like curls which
clustered about her forehead; but she said never a word. She had no
occasion to tell them the history of that meeting in the rain, or of
those many subsequent meetings which had drifted her into almost the
familiarity of an old friendship. They might take credit to themselves
for having made her acquainted with their star if they liked. She had
seen plenty of smart people at Dinan in those sunny summer months
when visitors came from Dinard to look at the old quiet inland city.
Lostwithiel's rank had no disturbing influence upon her mind. It was
himself&mdash;something in his look and in his voice, in the mere touch of
his hand&mdash;an indescribable something which of late had moved her in his
presence, and made her faintly tremulous at the sound of his name.</p>

<p>He was announced while they were talking of him, and he seemed
surprised to come suddenly upon that slim unobtrusive figure almost
hidden by Belinda's flowing garment and fuller form. Belinda was
decidedly handsome&mdash;handsomer than an heiress need be; but she was also
just a shade larger than an heiress need be at three and twenty. She
was a Rubens' beauty, expansive, florid, and fair, with reddish auburn
hair piled on the top of her head. Sitting between this massive beauty
and the still more massive chimney-piece, Mrs. Disney was completely
hidden from the new arrival.</p>

<p>He discovered her suddenly while he was shaking hands with Belinda,
and his quick glance of pleased surprise did not escape that young
lady's steely blue eyes. Not a look or a breath ever does escape
observation in a village drawing-room. Even the intellectual people,
the people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> devour all Mudie's most solid books&mdash;travels, memoirs,
metaphysics, agnostic novels&mdash;even these are as keenly interested in
their neighbours' thoughts and feelings as the unlettered rustic in the
village street.</p>

<p>Lostwithiel took the proffered cup of tea, and planted himself near
Mrs. Disney, with his back against the marble caryatid which bore up
one-half of the chimney-piece. Alicia began to talk to him about his
yacht. How were the repairs going on? and so on, and so on, delighted
to air her technical knowledge. He answered her somewhat languidly, as
if the <i>Vendetta</i> were not first in his thoughts at this particular
moment.</p>

<p>"What about this ball?" he asked presently. "You are all going to be
there, of course?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the hunt ball at Lostwithiel?"</p>

<p>"Of course! What other ball could I mean? It is the great festivity
of these parts. The one tremendous event of the winter season. It was
a grand idea of you new people to revive the old festivity, which had
become a tradition. I wore my first dress coat at the Lostwithiel Hunt
Ball nearly twenty years ago. I think it was there I first fell in
love, with a young lady in pink tulle, who was miserable because she
had been mistaken enough to wear pink at a hunt ball. I condoled with
her, assured her that in my eyes she was lovely, although her gown
clashed&mdash;that was her word, I remember&mdash;with the pink coats. My coat
was not pink, and I believe she favoured me a little on that account.
She gave me a good many waltzes in the course of the evening, and I can
answer for her never wearing that pink frock again, for I trampled it
to shreds. There were traces of her to be found all over the rooms, as
if I had been Greenacre and she my victim's body."</p>

<p>"It will be rather a humdrum ball, I'm afraid," said Belinda. "All the
best people seem to be away."</p>

<p>"Never mind that if the worst people can dance. I am on the committee,
so I will answer for the supper and the champagne. You like a dry
brand, of course, Miss Crowther?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never touch wine of any kind."</p>

<p>"No; then my chief virtue will be thrown away upon you. Are all young
ladies blue-ribbonites nowadays, I wonder? Mrs. Disney, pray tell me
you are interested in the champagne question."</p>

<p>"I am not going to the ball."</p>

<p>"Not going! Oh, but it is a duty which you owe to the county! Do you
think because you are an alien and a foreigner you can flout our local
gaieties&mdash;fleer at our solemnities? No, it is incumbent upon you to
give us your support."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, you must go to the ball," put in Mrs. Crowther, in her
motherly tone. "You are much too young and pretty to stay at home, like
Cinderella, while we are all enjoying ourselves. Of course you must go.
Mr. Crowther has put down his name for five and twenty tickets, and I'm
sure there'll be one to spare for you, although we shall have a large
house-party."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are too kind, but I couldn't think&mdash;&mdash;" faltered Isola,
with a distressed look.</p>

<p>She knew that Lostwithiel was watching her from his vantage ground
ever so far above her head. A man of six feet two has considerable
advantages at a billiard-table, and in a quiet flirtation carried on in
public.</p>

<p>"If it is a chaperon you are thinking about, I'll take care of you,"
urged good Mrs. Crowther.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't on that account. Mrs. Baynham offered to take me in her
party. But I really would much rather not be there. It would seem
horrid to me to be dancing in a great, dazzling room, among happy
people, while Martin is in Burmah, perhaps in peril of his life on that
very night. One can never tell. I often shudder at the thought of what
may be happening to him while I am sitting quietly by the fire. And
what should I feel at a ball?"</p>

<p>"I should hardly have expected you to have such romantic notions about
Major Disney," said Belinda, coolly, "considering the difference in
your ages."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you suppose I care the less for him because he is twenty years
older than I am?"</p>

<p>"Twenty! Is it really as much as that?" ejaculated Mrs. Crowther,
unaffectedly shocked.</p>

<p>"He is just as dear to me," pursued Isola, warmly. "I look up to him,
and love him with all my heart. There never was a better, truer man.
From the time I began to read history I always admired great soldiers.
I don't mean to say that Martin is a hero&mdash;only I know he is a thorough
soldier&mdash;and he seemed to realize all my childish dreams."</p>

<p>She had spoken impetuously, fancying that there was some slight towards
her absent husband in Miss Crowther's speech. Her flash of anger made
a break in the conversation, and nothing more was said about her going
or not going to the Hunt Ball. They talked of that entertainment in the
abstract&mdash;discussed the floor&mdash;the lighting&mdash;the band&mdash;and the great
people who might be induced to appear, if the proper pressure were put
upon them.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of time," said Lostwithiel, "between now and the
twenty-second of December&mdash;nearly three weeks. Time for you and your
sister to get new frocks from London or Paris, Miss Crowther. You mean
having new frocks, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"One generally does have a new frock for a dance," replied Belinda,
"though the fashions this winter are so completely odious that I would
much rather appear in a gown of my great-grandmother's."</p>

<p>Lostwithiel smiled his slow secret smile high up in the fainter
firelight. He was reflecting upon his notion of Miss Crowther's
great-grandmother, in linsey-wolsey, with a lavender print apron, a
costume that would be hardly impressive at a Hunt Ball. He did not give
the young lady credit for a great-grandmother from the Society point
of view. There was the mother yonder&mdash;inoffensive respectability&mdash;the
grandmother would be humbler&mdash;and the great-grandmother he imagined
at the wash-tub, or cooking the noontide meal for an artisan
husband. He had never yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> realized the idea of numerous generations
of middle-class life upon the same plane, the same dead level of
prosperous commerce.</p>

<p>Isola rose to take leave, after having let her tea get cold, and
dropped half her cake on the Persian rug. She felt shyer in that house
than in any other. She had a feeling that there she was weighed in the
balance and found wanting; that unfriendly eyes were scrutinizing her
gloves and hat, and appraising her features and complexion. She felt
herself insignificant, colourless, insipid beside that brilliant Miss
Crowther, with her vivid beauty, and her self-assured airs and graces.</p>

<p>Tabitha urged her to be of good heart when she hinted at these feelings.</p>

<p>"Why, Lord have mercy upon us, ma'am, however grand they may all look,
it's nothing but wool&mdash;only wool; and I heard there used to be a good
deal of devil's dust mixed with it, after this Mr. Crowther came into
the business."</p>

<p>The dusk was thickening as she went along the short avenue which led
to the gates. Mr. Crowther, having built his house in a wood, had been
able to cut himself out a carriage drive, which gave him an avenue of
more than two centuries' growth, and thus imparted an air of spurious
antiquity to his demesne. He felt, as he looked at the massive boles of
those old Spanish chestnuts, as if he had belonged to the soil since
the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Even the lodge was an important building, Tudor on one side, and
monastic on the other; with that agreeable hodge-podge of styles which
the modern architect loveth. It was a better house than the curate
lived in, as he often told Miss Crowther.</p>

<p>Isola quickened her pace outside that solemn gateway, and seemed to
breathe more freely. She hurried even faster at the sound of a footstep
behind her, though there was no need for nervous apprehensions at that
early hour in the November evening on the high road between Fowey
and Trelasco. Did she know that firm, quick footfall; or was it an
instinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> avoidance of an unknown danger which made her hurry on
till her heart began to beat stormily, and her breath came in short
gasps?</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Disney, do you usually walk as if for a wager?" asked a
voice behind her. "I can generally get over the ground pretty fast, but
it was as much as I could do to overtake you without running."</p>

<p>He was not breathless, however. His tones were firm and tranquil. It
was she who could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am very late," she answered nervously.</p>

<p>"For what? For afternoon tea by your own fireside? Have you anybody
waiting for you at the Angler's Nest, that you should be in such a
hurry to get home?"</p>

<p>"No, there is no one waiting, except Tabitha. I expect no one."</p>

<p>"Then why walk yourself into a fever?"</p>

<p>"Tabitha gets fidgety if I am out after dusk."</p>

<p>"Then let Tabitha fidget! It will be good for her liver. Those adipose
people require small worries to keep them in health. You mustn't
over-pace yourself to oblige Tabitha."</p>

<p>She had slackened her steps, and he was walking by her side, looking
down at her from that superb altitude which gave him an unfair
advantage. How could she, upon her lower level, escape those searching
glances?</p>

<p>She knew that her way home was his way home, so far as the bend of
the road which led away from the river; and to avoid him for the
intervening distance would have been difficult. She must submit to his
company on the road, or make a greater effort than it was in her nature
to make.</p>

<p>"You mean to go to this ball, don't you?" he asked earnestly.</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"Oh, but pray do! Why should you shut yourself from all the pleasures
of this world, and live like a nun, always? You might surely make just
one exception for such a grand event as the Hunt Ball. You have no
idea how much we all think of it hereabouts. Remember, it will be the
first public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> dance we have had at Lostwithiel for ever so many years.
You will see family diamonds enough to make you fancy you are at St.
James's. Do you think Major Disney would dislike your having just one
evening's dissipation?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, he would not mind! He is only too kind and indulgent. He would
have liked me to spend the winter with my sister in Hans Place, where
there would have been gaieties of all kinds; but I don't want to go
into society while Martin is away. It would not make me happy."</p>

<p>"But if it made some one else happy&mdash;if it made other people happy to
see you there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but it would not matter to anybody! I am a stranger in the land.
People are only kind to me for my husband's sake."</p>

<p>"Your modesty becomes you as the dew becomes a rose. I won't gainsay
you&mdash;only be sure you will be missed if you don't go to the ball. And
if you do go&mdash;well, it will be an opportunity of making nice friends.
It will be your <i>début</i> in county society."</p>

<p>"Without my husband? Please don't say any more about it, Lord
Lostwithiel. I had much rather stay at home."</p>

<p>He changed the conversation instantly, asking her what she thought of
Glenaveril.</p>

<p>"I think the situation most lovely."</p>

<p>"Yes, there we are all agreed. Mr. Crowther had the good taste to
find a charming site, and the bad taste to erect an architectural
monstrosity, a chimera in red brick. There was a grange once in the
heart of that wood, and the Crowthers have the advantage of acorns and
chestnuts that sowed themselves while the sleepy old monks were telling
their beads. How do you like Miss Crowther?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know her well enough to like or dislike her. She is very
handsome."</p>

<p>"So was Rubens' wife, Helena Forman; but what would one do in a world
peopled with Helena Formans? There are galleries in Antwerp which no
man should enter without smoke-coloured spectacles, if he would avoid
being blinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> by a blaze of red-haired beauty. I am told that the Miss
Crowthers will have, at least, a million of money between them in days
to come, and that they are destined to make great matches. Perhaps we
shall see some of their <i>soupirants</i> at the ball. Since the decay of
the landed interest, the <i>chasse aux dots</i> has become fiercer than of
old."</p>

<p>This seemed to come strangely from him who had already been talked of
as a possible candidate for one of the Miss Crowthers. It would be such
a particularly suitable match, Mrs. Baynham, the doctor's wife, had
told Isola. What could his lordship look for beyond a fine fortune and
a handsome wife?</p>

<p>"They would make such a splendid pair," said Mrs. Baynham, talking of
them as if they were carriage-horses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Disney and her companion crossed a narrow meadow, from the high
road to the river-path which was the nearest way to the Angler's Nest.
The river went rippling by under the gathering grey of the November
evening. On their right hand there was the gloom of dark woods: and
from the meadow on their left rose a thick white mist, like a sea
that threatened to swallow them up in its phantasmal tide. The sound
of distant oars, dipping with rhythmical measure, was the only sound
except their own voices.</p>

<p>Did that three-quarters of a mile seem longer or shorter than usual?
Isola hardly knew; but when she saw the lights shining in Tabitha's
kitchen, and the fire-glow in the drawing-room, she was glad with the
gladness of one who escapes from some fancied danger of ghosts or
goblins.</p>

<p>Lostwithiel detained her at the gate.</p>

<p>"Good night," he said; "good night. You will change your mind, won't
you, Mrs. Disney? It is not in one so gentle as you to be inflexible
about such a trifle. Say that you will honour our ball."</p>

<p>She drew herself up a little, as if in protest against his pertinacity.</p>

<p>"I really cannot understand why you should care whether I go or stay
away," she said coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but I do care! It is childish, perhaps, on my part, but I do care;
I care tremendously; more than I have cared about anything for a long
time. It is so small a thing on your part&mdash;it means so much for me! Say
you will be there."</p>

<p>"Is that you, ma'am?" asked Tabitha's pleasant voice, while Tabitha's
substantial soles made themselves audible upon the gravel path. "I was
beginning to get fidgety about you."</p>

<p>"Good night," said Isola, shortly, as she passed through the gate.</p>

<p>It shut with a sharp little click of the latch, and she vanished among
the laurels and arbutus. He heard her voice and Tabitha's as they
walked towards the house in friendly conversation, mistress and maid.</p>

<p>There was a great over-blown Dijon rose nodding its heavy head over
the fence. Roses linger so late in that soft western air. Lostwithiel
plucked the flower, and pulled off its petals one by one as he walked
towards the village street.</p>

<p>"Will she go&mdash;will she stay&mdash;go&mdash;stay&mdash;go&mdash;stay?" he muttered, as the
petals fluttered to the ground.</p>

<p>"Go! Yes, of course she will go," he said to himself as the last leaf
fell. "Does it need ghost from the grave or rose from the garden to
tell me that?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></p>

<p class="center">"DREAMING, SHE KNEW IT WAS A DREAM."</p>


<p>Isola and Lostwithiel met a good many times after that walk through
the autumn mists. She tried her utmost to avoid him. She went for
fewer walks than of old; nay, she chiefly confined her perambulations
to those domestic errands which Tabitha imposed upon her, and such
afternoon visits as she felt it incumbent upon her to pay, in strict
return for visits paid to her. Major Disney had begged her to be exact
in such small ceremonies, and to keep upon the best possible terms with
his friends. "I love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> every soul in the place, for old sake's sake," he
told her; and for old sake's sake Isola had to cultivate the people her
husband had known all his life.</p>

<p>She tried to avoid Lostwithiel, but Fate was against her, and they met.
He was unvaryingly courteous. He said no word which could offend the
most sensitive of women. Prudery itself could have had no ground for
alarm. He did not again allude to the ball, or his wishes upon that
point. He talked of those common topics of interest to which every day
and every season give rise, even in a Cornish village; and yet in this
common talk acquaintance ripened until it became friendship unawares.
And then&mdash;as all sense of shyness and reserve upon Isola's part
gave way to a vague, reposeful feeling, like drifting down a sunlit
river, with never a breath of chilling wind&mdash;they began to exchange
confidences about their past lives. Unawares Martin Disney's wife found
herself entering into the minutest details about the people she had met
on that level road of a monotonous girlhood by which she had come to be
what she was. Unawares she betrayed all her feelings and opinions, her
likes and dislikes, and even the little weaknesses and eccentricities
of her parents&mdash;her sister&mdash;her wealthy brother-in-law. Never before
had she found so good a listener. Her husband had been all affectionate
interest in the things that concerned her; yet she had often discovered
that his mind was wandering in the midst of some girlish reminiscence;
and he had a tiresome trick of forgetting all those particulars about
her friends which would have enabled him to distinguish the personages
of a story. He had to be told everything afresh at each recurrence of
those names that were so familiar to her. Nor had he Lostwithiel's keen
sense of humour, and quick perception of the ridiculous side of life,
whereby many a small social sketch fell flat.</p>

<p>The glimpses she caught of her new friend's past existence enthralled
her. It was to see new vistas opening into unknown worlds; the world of
university life; the world of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> society, English and continental, with
all its varieties of jargon; the world of politics, and literature, and
art. It charmed him to see her interest in all those unknown things and
people.</p>

<p>"You would very soon be tired of it, and would come back to
Trelasco&mdash;like the hare to her form&mdash;or like me," he said, smiling at
her ardent look. "Believe me, it is all dust and ashes. My happiest
hours have been on board a yacht, with only half a dozen good books,
and ten or a dozen ignoramuses in blue serge for my companions."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was to go to the Hunt Ball after all; not because he wished it,
but because other people had taken her affairs in hand, and decided
that she should go. Dr. and Mrs. Baynham had decided for her. Mrs.
Vansittart Crowther had decided for her, and had sent her a ticket
with her love by that very footman whose appearance when he opened the
door always crushed her, and who had given her a frightful shock when
she danced into the kitchen to speak to Tabitha, and found him meekly
sitting on a Windsor chair, with his knees drawn up nearly to his chin.
Lastly, Tabitha had decided; and Tabitha's opinion went for more than
that of anybody else.</p>

<p>"You want a little bit of change and gaiety," said the faithful
stewardess. "You have been looking pale and worried ever since you had
that bad news from Broomer," this was Tabitha's nearest approach to
Burmah, "and you'll be all the better for an evening's pleasure. It
isn't as if you had to buy a dress, or even a pair of gloves. You've
only worn your wedding-dress at three parties since you came home from
your honeymoon, and it's as fresh as if you'd been married yesterday.
You've got everything, and everything of the best. Why shouldn't you
go?"</p>

<p>Isola could advance no reason, except her vague fear that her husband
might not approve of her appearing at a public ball without him; but at
this objection honest Tabitha snapped her fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll answer for Mr. Martin," she said. "He'll be pleased for you to
enjoy yourself. 'Don't let her mope while I'm away, Tabby,' he said to
me the day before he started for foreign parts. He'd like you to be at
the ball. You'll have Mrs. Baynham to take care of you, and what can
you want more than that, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham, the portly doctor's wife, was, in Tabitha's mind, the
representative of all the respectabilities. How could a girl just out
of her teens&mdash;a girl who loved dancing, and had been told she danced
exquisitely&mdash;turn a deaf ear to such arguments, put forward by the
person to whose care her husband had in some wise confided her. If
Tabitha approved, Isola thought she could not do wrong in yielding;
so the simply-fashioned white satin gown&mdash;made in Paris, and with all
Parisian <i>chic</i>&mdash;was taken out of the pot-pourri perfumed drawer.
Gloves and fan, and little white slippers were passed in review. There
was nothing wanted. The carefullest housewife need not have hesitated
on the score of economy.</p>

<p>So the question was finally settled&mdash;she was to go to the Hunt Ball. A
fly was engaged for her especial service, so that she might not crowd
Mrs. Baynham, who was to take two fresh, fat-cheeked nieces, who looked
as if they had been fed from infancy upwards upon apple pasties and
clotted cream. She was to drive to Lostwithiel in the fly from the
Maypole Inn, and she was to join Mrs. Baynham in the cloak-room, and
make her entrance under that lady's wing.</p>

<p>This final decision was arrived at about ten days before the event, and
for nine of those intervening days Isola's life went by as if she were
always sitting in that imaginary boat drifting down a sunlit river;
but on the day of the dance, after just half an hour's quiet walk with
Lostwithiel on the towpath, she went back to the cottage pale as ashes;
and sat down at her little davenport in the drawing-room, trembling,
breathless, and on the verge of hysteria.</p>

<p>She opened the drawers of the davenport one after another, looking
for something&mdash;helplessly, confusedly, as one whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> brain is half
distraught. It was ten minutes before she found what she wanted&mdash;a
sheaf of telegram forms.</p>

<p>"To Major Disney, Cornwall Fusiliers, Rangoon.&mdash;Let me go to you at
once. I am miserable. My heart will break if you leave me here."</p>

<p>This was the gist of a message which she wrote half a dozen times, in
different words, upon half a dozen forms. Then she tore up all but the
last, threw that into a drawer, and began to pace the room feverishly,
with her hands clasped before her face.</p>

<p>What fever-fraught vision was it that those hands tried to shut out
from her burning eyes? So little had happened&mdash;so little&mdash;only half an
hour's quiet walk along the towpath, where the leafless willows had a
grim, uncanny look, like those trees whose old grey branches seemed the
arms of the Erlking's daughters, beckoning the child as he nestled in
his father's arms, riding through the night. So little&mdash;so little&mdash;and
yet it meant the lifting of a veil&mdash;the passage from happy innocence
to the full consciousness of an unholy love. It meant what one kiss on
trembling lips meant for Paolo and Francesca. It meant the plunge into
a gulf of dark despair&mdash;unless she had strength to draw back, seeing
the abyss at her feet, warned of her danger.</p>

<p>What had he said? Only a few agitated words&mdash;only a revelation. He
loved her, loved her with all the passion of his passionate soul; loved
her as he had never loved before. They all tell the same story, these
destroyers of innocence; and, for that one burning moment, they all
mean what they say. Every seducer has his hour of sublime truthfulness;
of generous feeling; of ardent heroic aspirations; the hour in which he
would perish for the woman he loves; cut off his right hand; burn out
his eyes; leap off a monument; do anything except surrender her, except
forego his privilege to destroy her.</p>

<p>It was not too late. The warning had come in time&mdash;just in time to
save her. She knew now to what ocean that drifting boat was carrying
her&mdash;through the sunny atmo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>sphere, between the flowery shores of
dreamland. It was taking her to the arctic ocean of shame and ruin&mdash;the
great sea strewn with the corpses of women who had sinned, and
suffered, and repented, and died&mdash;unforgiven of mankind&mdash;to wait the
tribunal of God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oh, lor!" cried Tabitha, bursting into the room. "I thought you were
never coming home. You ought to go and lay down for two or three hours
after your tea, or we shall have you fainting away before the night's
over. You've not been eating enough for a healthy canary bird for the
last week."</p>

<p>"I'm not very well, Tabbie. I don't think I'll go to the ball."</p>

<p>"Not go! and when the fly's ordered&mdash;and will have to be paid for
whether or no; for Masters told me he could have let it twelve deep.
Not go! and disappoint Mrs. Baynham, who has set her heart on taking
you; and Mrs. Crowther, who gave you the ticket! Why, it would never
do! You'll feel well enough when you're there. You won't know whether
you're standing on your head or your heels. It's past five o'clock, and
your tea has been ready in the study since a quarter to."</p>

<p>"How do you send telegrams to India, Tabitha?"</p>

<p>"Lor, ma'am, how should I know? From the post-office, I suppose, pretty
much like other telegrams. But they cost no end of money, I'll be
bound. You're not wanting to send a telegram to the major, are you,
ma'am, to ask his leave about the ball?"</p>

<p>"No; I was only wondering," Isola answered feebly.</p>

<p>She shut and locked the davenport, leaving her message in the drawer.
She meant to send it&mdash;if not to-day, to-morrow; if not before the
ball, after the ball. She felt that her only hope of peace and safety
and a clear conscience was at her husband's side. She must go out to
him yonder in the unknown land. She must get to him somehow, with or
without his leave&mdash;with or without his help. She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> brave anything,
hazard anything to be with that faithful friend and defender&mdash;her first
love&mdash;her brave, self-denying, God-fearing lover. She felt as if there
were no other safety or shelter for her in all the world.</p>

<p>"God will not help me unless I help myself," she muttered distractedly,
as she sat in her low chair by the fire, with her head flung back upon
the cushions and the untouched meal at her side. Tabitha had left off
providing dinner for her, at her particular request. She had neither
heart to sit down alone to a formal dinner nor appetite to eat it; so
Tabitha had exercised all her skill as a cook, which was great, in
preparing a dainty little supper at nine o'clock; and it had irked her
that her mistress did such scant justice to the tempting meal.</p>

<p>Isola fell asleep by the fire, comforted by the warmth, worn out by
nights that had been made sleepless by vague agitation&mdash;by the living
over again of accidental meetings, and friendly conversations&mdash;not
by fear or remorse&mdash;for it was only this day that the danger of that
growing friendship had been revealed to her. It was only to-day that
she knew what such friendships mean. She slept a feverish sleep, from
sheer exhaustion, and dreamt fever-dreams.</p>

<p>Those willows on the bank had recalled Goethe's "Erl König"&mdash;the
ballad she had learnt by rote in her earliest German studies&mdash;and the
willows and the ballad were interwoven with her dreams. It was Martin
Disney who was riding his charger along a dark road, and she was
sitting in front of his saddle, clinging to him, hiding her face upon
his breast, and the willows were beckoning&mdash;she knew those gaunt arms
were beckoning to her, although her eyes were hidden&mdash;and <i>he</i> was
following. He was thundering behind them, on a black horse. Yes, and
then the dream changed&mdash;the dreamer's wandering thoughts directed by
another reminiscence of those girlish studies in German poetry. She was
Lenore, and she was in the arms of her dead lover. She felt that bony
arm&mdash;Death's arm&mdash;clutching her round the waist. Her streaming hair
mingled with the streaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> mane of that unearthly horse. She was with
Lostwithiel&mdash;in his arms&mdash;and they were both dead and both happy&mdash;happy
in being together. What did they want more than that?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Vollbracht, vollbracht ist unser Lauf!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Das Hochzeitbette, thut sich auf!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Die Todten reiten schnelle!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wir sind, wir sind, zur Stelle."</span><br />
</p>

<p>She woke with the chill of the charnel-house freezing her blood. The
fire had gone out. Tim had curled himself at her feet in the folds of
her gown. The Persian was staring discontentedly at the ashes in the
grate, and Tabitha's sturdy footsteps might be heard in the room above,
bustling to and fro, and anon poking the fire, and putting on coals,
making all snug and ready for her mistress's toilet.</p>

<p>Isola rang, and Susan, the parlour-maid, brought in the lamp.</p>

<p>"I came twice before, ma'am; but you were fast asleep, so I took the
lamp back to the pantry."</p>

<p>Isola looked at the clock. Ten minutes to nine, and she was to meet
Mrs. Baynham in the cloak-room at half-past ten. Ten o'clock was the
hour on the card, and the fat-faced nieces were feverishly afraid that
all the eligible partners would be snapped up by those wise virgins who
appeared earliest on the scene.</p>

<p>"You won't keep us waiting in the cloak-room, will you, dear Mrs.
Disney?" they pleaded coaxingly.</p>

<p>Was she to put on her finery and go! There would be time yet to send
a note to Mrs. Baynham, excusing herself on the score of illness. The
doctor's party would not start before half-past nine. What was she
to do? Oh, she wanted to see him once more&mdash;just once more&mdash;in the
brightly-lighted rooms, amidst a crowd&mdash;in a place where he would have
no chance of repeating those wicked, wicked words&mdash;of forgetting all
that was due to his own honour and to hers. In the crowded ball-room
there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> safety&mdash;safety even from evil thoughts. Who could think
of anything amidst the sound of dance music, the dazzle of lamps and
flashing of jewels?</p>

<p>She wanted to go to the ball, to wear her satin gown, to steep herself
in light and music; and thus to escape from the dim horrors of that
awful dream.</p>

<p>Tabitha seemed like a good angel, when she came in at this juncture
with a fresh cup of tea and a plate of dainty little chicken sandwiches.</p>

<p>"Come now, ma'am, I shan't let you go to the ball if you don't take
these. What, not a bit of fire&mdash;and you asleep here in the cold? What
was that addle-pated Susan thinking about, I wonder? I'll take the tray
upstairs. There's a lovely fire in your room, and everything ready for
you to dress. I want to be able to tell Mr. Martin that his young wife
was the belle of the ball."</p>

<p>Isola allowed herself to be led upstairs to the bright, cheerful
bedroom, with its pretty chintz-pattern paper, and photographs, and
artistic muslin curtains, and glowing fire, and toilet-table, with
its glitter of crystal and silver in the pleasant candlelight. She
suffered herself to be fed and dressed by Tabitha's skilful hands,
almost as if she had been a child; and she came out of her dismal dream
into the glad waking world, a radiant figure, with violet eyes and
alabaster complexion, flushed by the loveliest hectic. The simply-made,
close-fitting bodice, with folded crape veiling the delicate bust, and
the pure pearly tint of the satin, set off her fragile beauty, while
the long train and massive folds of the rich fabric gave statuesque
grace to her tall, slim figure; but the crowning glory of her toilette
was the garland of white chrysanthemums, for which Tabitha had
ransacked all the neighbouring green-houses; a garland of fluffy,
feathery petals, which reached in a diagonal line from her shoulder
to the hem of her gown. It was her only ornament, for by some strange
caprice she refused to wear the modest pearl necklace and diamond cross
which had been her husband's wedding gift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not to-night, Tabbie," she said; and Tabitha saw in this refusal only
the coquetry of a lovely woman, who wanted to show the great ladies and
squire's wives how poor and common diamonds are by the side of youth
and beauty.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't want any jewels, certainly," said Tabitha. "You
look as if you were going to be married&mdash;all but the veil. Those
chrysanthemums are ever so much prettier than orange blossoms. There's
the fly. Let me put on your cloak. It's a beautiful night, and almost
as mild as May. Everybody will be at the ball. There's nothing to keep
folks away. Well, I do wish the major was here to go with you. Wouldn't
he be proud?"</p>

<p>The stars were shining when Isola went along the gravel path to
the gate where Masters' fly was waiting, with blazing lamps, which
seemed to put those luminous worlds yonder to shame. There was no
carriage-drive to the hall door of the Angler's Nest. The house
retained all its ancient simplicity, and ignored the necessities of
carriage people. Tabitha wrapped her mistress's fur-lined cloak close
round her, before she stepped into the fly, which was provided with
those elaborate steps that seem peculiar to the hired brougham.</p>

<p>"Good night, Tabitha, and thank you for all the pains you've taken in
dressing me&mdash;and for the lovely wreath. I shall come home early. I
shan't wait for Mrs. Baynham's party."</p>

<p>"Don't you hurry," said Tabitha, heartily. "The Hunt Ball only comes
once a year, and you'd better make the most of it. I shan't mind
sitting up; and perhaps I shan't be half so dull as you think for."</p>

<p>The flyman shut the door, which nobody but himself could shut&mdash;another
peculiarity of hired broughams. The fly vanished in the darkness,
and Tabitha ran back to the house, where she found Susan waiting at
the hall door in her jacket and hat, as near a reproduction of Mrs.
Disney's jacket and hat as local circumstances&mdash;or the difference
between Bond Street and Lostwithiel&mdash;would allow.</p>

<p>"Have you locked and bolted the back doors?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> Tabitha; "but, lor,
I'll go and look myself; I won't trust to your giddy young brains. Mr.
Tinkerly will be here with the cart directly. I've only got to put on
my bonnet and dolman, after I've taken a look round, and put away Mrs.
Disney's jewel-box."</p>

<p>Tabitha was no light-minded housekeeper, but she had her hours of
frivolity, and she loved pleasure with the innocent freshness of a
most transparent soul. Tinkerly, the butcher, had offered to drive the
two ladies&mdash;Tabitha and Susan&mdash;into Lostwithiel in his tax cart, and,
furthermore, to place them where they would see something of the ball,
or at least of the company arriving and departing, and beyond all this
to give them a snack of supper, "Just something to bite at and a glass
of beer," he told Tabitha deprecatingly, lest he should raise hopes
beyond his power of realization.</p>

<p>He meant to do the thing as handsomely as circumstances would permit,
certainly to the extent of cold boiled beef and pickles, with Guinness
or Bass. He was a family man, of irreproachable respectability, and his
meat was supposed to be unmatchable for thirty miles round. He grew it
himself, upon those picturesque pastures which sloped skyward, dipping
towards the blue of the river, rising towards the blue of the sky.</p>

<p>No precaution of lock, bolt, or bar did Tabitha neglect before she
put on her best bonnet, and dignified black cloth dolman, heavy with
imitation Astrachan. She and Susan were standing at the gate when
Tinkerly drove up with his skittish mare and spring cart, a cart
so springy that it threatened to heel over altogether when Tabitha
clambered into the place of honour. Mr. Tinkerly's foreman was sitting
behind to take care of Susan, and the foreman was unmarried, and of a
greasy black-haired comeliness, and there was none happier than Susan
under those wintry stars&mdash;not even the great ladies in their family

<p>"What are diamonds," said Susan, philosophically, with the foreman's
arm sustaining her at a sharp turn in the road, "if you don't care for
each other?"</p>

<p class="center">"AND THE CHILD-CHEEK BLUSHING SCARLET FOR THE VERY SHAME OF BLISS."</p>


<p>People who were familiar with the Talbot Hotel, Lostwithiel, in its
everyday aspect would hardly have recognized the old-fashioned hostelry
to-night, under the transforming hand of the Hunt Club, with Lord
Lostwithiel and Vansittart Crowther on the committee. The entrance
hall, usually remarkable only for various cases of stuffed birds, and
a monster salmon&mdash;caught in the Lerrin river in some remote period of
history&mdash;was now a bower of crimson cloth and white azaleas. In the
ball-room and ante-room, tea-room and supper-room, were more flowers,
and more crimson cloth, while on every side brushes and vizards
against the crimson and white panelling testified to the occasion.
The dancing-room was very full when Mrs. Baynham's party made their
entrance, the matron in her historical black velvet&mdash;which had formed
part of her trousseau thirteen years before, when she left the family
residence in the chief street of Truro, and all those privileges which
appertained to her as the only daughter of a provincial banker, to
grace Dr. Baynham's lowlier dwelling. The black velvet gown had been
"let out" from time to time, as youth expanded into maturity: and there
had been a new bodice and a real Maltese lace flounce within the last
three years, which constituted a second incarnation; and Mrs. Baynham
walked into the Talbot ball-room with the serene demeanour that goes
with a contented mind. She was satisfied with herself, and she was
proud of her party, the two fresh, rosy-cheeked girls in sky-blue
tulle, Isola, looking like a Mary lily in her white satin raiment, and
the village surgeon, who always looked his best in his dress clothes,
newly-shaven, and, as it were, pulled together in honour of the
occasion.</p>

<p>The room was full, and very full; but Lostwithiel was not there. Isola
had an instinctive consciousness that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> missing in that brilliant
crowd. People came buzzing round her, and she was made room for upon a
raised bench opposite the gallery where a military band was playing a
polka in which the brasses predominated to an ear-splitting extent.</p>

<p>The Glenaveril party made their entrance ten minutes later. The
Crowther girls were not afraid of wanting partners. Most young men
are glad to dance with half a million of money. There is always an
off chance of a good thing, just as there is a chance of breaking
the bank at Monte Carlo. Belinda looked superb in a cloud of tulle,
like a goddess. Alicia looked too well on horseback to look well off.
Her spare straight figure and sharp elbows were not at their best in
evening dress. She wore black, and an infinity of bugles, and flashed
and glittered more than any one else in the room, though she wore never
a jewel.</p>

<p>"Worth, my dear," said Mrs. Baynham to a blue niece, in a mysterious
whisper; "I know his style."</p>

<p>There was a buzz of conversation on that raised divan where the
matrons were sitting with those newly arrived maidens who were like
ships waiting to slide out of their cradles and float away to sea.
Isola and the sky-blue nieces had not long to wait; especially
Isola. Men were entreating the stewards to introduce them to that
lovely fragile-looking creature in white satin&mdash;the best men in the
neighbourhood, or those wandering stars from distant counties, or the
London galaxy, "men with handles to their names," as Mr. Baynham told
Mrs. Crowther, resplendent in salmon brocade, and Venetian point.</p>

<p>"My presentation gown," she informed the doctor's wife; "the Court
mantle is ruby velvet, lined with salmon satin. The weight of it
almost pulled me backwards when I curtsied to the royalties&mdash;such a
lot of them, and I'm afraid I curtsied rather too low to one of the
Princesses, for I caught her taking me off when she returned my curtsy."</p>

<p>Isola danced through the lancers as one in a dream. When the heart of
a man is oppressed with care, "Ta-rarra, ta-rarra, ta-rà, ta-rà!" What
foolishness it all seemed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> And her husband in Burmah, hemmed round by
murderous dacoits!</p>

<p>She went back to her seat among the matrons, after almost curtly
refusing either refreshment or a promenade through the rooms. Mrs.
Crowther was saying solemnly, "I do believe Lord Lostwithiel is not
coming after all, and yet he worked so hard on the committee, my
husband said, and took such pains about the flowers, and what not."</p>

<p>The tall, slim figure cut its way through the crowd two or three
minutes later, and Lostwithiel was standing in front of Isola, and the
two matrons.</p>

<p>He wore a pink coat, as became a member of the Lostwithiel Hunt, and
the vivid colour accentuated the pallor of his long thin face. He
talked to all the ladies on the divan; to the sky-blue nieces even,
hoping that their cards were full.</p>

<p>"If not, I must bring you some men I know," he said. "You mustn't miss
a dance."</p>

<p>They blushed and trembled with delight, never before having been thus
familiarly addressed by a peer of the realm. He asked Isola for her
programme, with well-simulated indifference, yet with that air of
profound respect with which he talked to all women.</p>

<p>"I hope you can spare me some waltzes," he said.</p>

<p>"She is only just come," said Mrs. Baynham.</p>

<p>"And yet her card is almost full. People have been very officious.
Here is a poor little waltz&mdash;number seven. May I have that, and number
eleven, and number&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't put down your name for anything later than number eleven.
I shall be gone long before those late dances."</p>

<p>"Oh, surely, you don't mean to desert us early. Remember this is the
one festive occasion of our lives as a sporting community. All our
other meetings are given up to carking care, financial difficulties,
and squabbling. I shall put down my name in these tempting blanks,
and if you disappoint me&mdash;well&mdash;it will only be like my previous
experiences as a fox-hunter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave her back her programme, with all the blanks filled in, and at
the bottom a word written, and triply underscored,</p>

<p class="center">
ἉΝΑΓΚΗ.
</p>

<p>They had talked of Victor Hugo's romantic story&mdash;that romance which
the great man so despised in after years that he was almost offended
if any one presumed to praise it in his hearing, although in the
half-century that has gone since Victor Hugo was a young man this story
of Notre Dame has been unsurpassed as an example of the romantic novel.
Lostwithiel had praised the book, and had talked of the monk Frollo,
and his fatal love&mdash;and that word Fatality, graven upon the wall of his
cell, and burnt into his soul.</p>

<p>Isola knew what those Greek letters meant. She dropped the little white
and gold programme as if it had been an adder. He went away to a duty
dance with a great lady of the district&mdash;a lady whose diamonds made a
light about her wherever she moved; and then he waltzed with Belinda
Crowther, to the admiration of the young lady's mother, and of two or
three other matrons on the divan by the door. Were they not a splendid
couple, she so brilliantly fair, he dark and pale, bronzed slightly
with exposure to the sun in warmer climates than this&mdash;not positively
handsome, but with such an interesting countenance. So, and so, and so
prosed the matrons, until various middle-aged cavaliers came to invite
them to the tea-room, where there was the usual drawback in the shape
of a frightful draught from open windows, which the dancers, coming in
flushed and heated, voted delicious.</p>

<p>"This will be a good night's work for me," said Dr. Baynham,
cheerfully, although he considered it his duty to warn his patients of
their danger.</p>

<p>Conscience thus satisfied, he could look on complacently as they eat
ices, and selected cool corners of the refreshment-room to flirt in.</p>

<p>"Next to a juvenile party, I don't know anything better&mdash;from a
professional point of view&mdash;than a public ball," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> said. "Your canvas
corridors, decorated with flowers and bunting, are a fortune to a
family practitioner."</p>

<p>Isola danced every dance. She hardly knew who her partners were. She
had only a sense of floating in a vortex of light and colour, to some
swinging melody. Everything was dream-like&mdash;but not horrible, as in
her dream by the fireside at home. This was a happy dream, as of a
creature with wings, who knew not of care in the present or a soul to
be saved in the future. And then came her waltz with Lostwithiel, and
that strong arm was round her, bearing her up as a flower is borne upon
a rushing tide, so that she had no consciousness of movement on her own
part, only of floating, floating, floating, to that languid three-time
melody.</p>

<p>It was the last popular waltz they were playing&mdash;a waltz that had been
last summer's delight in the arid gardens of South Kensington&mdash;"Il n'y
a que toi;" a waltz with a chorus which the band trolled out merrily,
at intervals, in the French of Stratford atte Bow.</p>

<p>"Il n'y a que toi," whispered Lostwithiel, with his lips close to the
soft brown hair above the white forehead. "Not a bad name for a waltz
when one is waltzing with just one person in the world."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out in the cool night there was a little knot of people as merry
after their homelier fashion as town and county in the ball-room. One
of the windows had been opened at the top for ventilation, and this
opening had been turned to advantage. A large, substantial kitchen
table had been placed in front of the window, and upon this improvised
platform stood Tabitha, Susan, the head chamber-maid, and the ostler's
wife&mdash;this last on sufferance, and evidently not in society&mdash;looking on
at the ball. The window was under a verandah, that sloped above these
spectators' heads. They were thus in dense shadow, and unseen by the
occupants of the lamp-lit room.</p>

<p>Susan was exuberant in her delight.</p>

<p>"I was never at a ball before," she said. "Oh, ain't it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> lovely? Don't
I wish I could dance like that? Lor, do look at that fat old party,
spinning round like a teetotum! Well, I never did! Don't she perspire!"
exclaimed Susan, indulging in a running commentary which left much to
be desired in the matter of refinement.</p>

<p>This unsophisticated damsel heartily admired youth and beauty, and the
smart frocks and flashing gems; but she was cruelly hard upon those
dancers whose charms were on the wane, or whose frocks were inferior or
ugly.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't," said Susan, "I wouldn't go to a ball like this if
I couldn't have everythink nice. Look at that tall girl in yeller. Did
you ever see such a scarecrow? I'd ever so much rather stay at home, or
stand outside, like this. I should feel it better became me."</p>

<p>Tabitha made no such remarks. She was singularly silent and thoughtful,
as she stood looking down at the crowded room from her point of vantage
on the kitchen table. She had only eyes for one figure&mdash;the willowy
form in the glistening white satin gown, with the feathery Japanese
chrysanthemums, a little crushed and faded by this time; or perhaps it
may be said for two figures, since one followed the other as the shadow
follows the substance. She saw them waltzing together, when supper
was in full progress, and the room comparatively clear. She saw the
graceful head inclining towards his shoulder, the slender waist held in
his firm embrace; and it seemed to her that the waltz was an invention
of the Arch Enemy. She thought of it very much as people thought
seventy years ago when Byron wrote his poetical denunciation of the new
dance. She saw those two moving slowly towards an adjacent ante-room,
where banks of flowers, and a couple of sofas and low easy-chairs made
a retreat which was half boudoir, half conservatory. She saw them
moving side by side, talking to each other in tones so confidential
that his head bent low over hers each time she spoke; and then she
watched them sitting just within the doorway, at an angle where she
could see their faces, and attitudes, still in the same confidential
converse, she with downcast eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> and he leaning forward with his
elbow on his knee, and looking up at her as he talked.</p>

<p>"It is too bad of him," muttered Tabitha, writhing at that spectacle.
"Does he think what a child she is, and what harm he may be doing?
It is wicked of him, and he knows it; and other people must notice
them&mdash;other people must see what I see&mdash;and they will be talking of
her, blighting her good name. Oh, if I could only get her away at once
before people begin to notice her!"</p>

<p>She could see her young mistress's face distinctly in the lamplight.
Isola was very pale, and her face was full of trouble; not the face
of a woman amusing herself with an idle flirtation, playing with fire
without the least intention of burning her fingers. There were plenty
of flirtations of that order going on in the Talbot ball-room; but this
was not one of them. This meant peril of some kind. This was all evil.
That pale face, those heavy eyelids, shrouding eyes which dared not
look up. That tremulous, uncertain movement of the snowy ostrich fan!
All these were danger signals.</p>

<p>"If I get her safe at home presently, I'll open her eyes for her,"
thought Tabitha. "I'll talk to her as if I was her mother. God knows I
should be almost as sorry as ever her mother could be if she came to
any harm."</p>

<p>If she came to any harm. What harm was there to fear for her, as she
sat there, with Lostwithiel lounging across the low chair beside the
sofa where she sat, leaning forward to look into her downcast face?
What harm could come to her except that which meant destruction&mdash;death
to peace, and gladness, and womanly fame? If there were danger it was
a desperate danger, and Tabitha shuddered at the mere thought of that
peril.</p>

<p>"But, lor, she's little more than a child," mused Tabitha. "She means
no wrong, and she knows no wrong. She's too innocent to come to any
harm."</p>

<p>Yet in the landlady's snuggery, by-and-by, seated at the comfortable
round table, with its spotless damask and bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> glass and silver,
Tabitha was quite unable to do justice to that snack which Mr.
Tinkerly had ordered in her honour&mdash;a chicken and lobster-salad from
the supper-room, and three parts of a pine-apple cream. Susan and the
foreman fully appreciated these dainties; but Tabitha only munched a
crust and sipped a tumbler of beer.</p>

<p>"I'm a little bit out of sorts to-night," she said.</p>

<p>"I hope you haven't taken cold, Mrs. Thomas," said the polite Tinkerly.
"Perhaps we ought to have brought another rug?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that. I've been quite warm and comfortable. Eat your
supper, Mr. Tinkerly, and don't bother about me. I've been interested
in looking on, and I'm too much took up with what I've seen to be able
to eat."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a pretty sight," exclaimed Tinkerly, enthusiastically;
"but I don't think I ever saw such a mort of plain women in my life."</p>

<p>"Lor, Mr. Tinkerly," cried Susan, with a shocked air. "Why, look at our
young mistress, and at Miss Crowther, and Miss Spenthrop from Truro,
and Mrs. Pencarrow, and Lady Chanderville."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't say they're all ugly. Some of 'em are handsome enough,
and there's plenty of thorough-breds among 'em, but there's a sight of
plain-headed ones. There's quite as much beauty in your spear as there
is among the county folks, Miss Susan. I'll answer for that."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The night was waning. Isola had ordered her carriage for half-past two:
but three o'clock had struck from the church tower of Lostwithiel, and
the dance was still at its height&mdash;at its best, the dancers said, now
that the sensual attractions of the supper-room drew off a good many
people, and left the floor so much clearer than before supper, when
bulky middle-aged gentlemen, talking to the matrons seated upon the
divan, had projected their ponderous persons into the orbit of the
waltzers.</p>

<p>Isola and Lostwithiel had danced only two waltzes, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> since two
o'clock they had sat out several dances, Mrs. Disney having cancelled
all her engagements after that hour by declaring that she would dance
no more.</p>

<p>"I am dreadfully tired," she told her partners piteously, and her
pallor gave force to the assertion. "Please get some one else for
our dance, Captain Morshead," and so on, and so on, to half a dozen
disappointed suitors.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of those who happened to be experienced in such
complications may have divined which way the wind blew, for no one
offered to sit out the promised dances, and Isola and Lostwithiel were
left pretty much to themselves among the palms and orange-trees in the
ante-room. They were not unobserved, however; and among the eyes which
marked them with no friendly notice were the fine, steel-blue eyes of
Miss Crowther.</p>

<p>"Is that a flirtation?" she asked Captain Morshead, glancing in the
direction of the ante-room where those two were sitting, as she and
Isola's cast-off partner waltzed past the muslin-draped doorway.</p>

<p>"They seem rather fond of talking to each other, don't they? Who was
she? She's uncommonly pretty."</p>

<p>"Oh, her people were army, I believe&mdash;as poor as church mice&mdash;buried
alive in Dinan."</p>

<p>"At Dinan&mdash;and now she lives at Trelasco, she tells me. It seems
scarcely worth while to have exhumed her in order to bury her again.
Such a girl as that ought to be in London enjoying life."</p>

<p>"Oh, but she's a grass widow, don't you know. Her husband is in Burmah.
I don't think it's quite nice in her to be here to-night; only as my
too good-natured mother sent her a ticket, I suppose I oughtn't to say
anything about it. Perhaps if mother sees the way she goes on with Lord
Lostwithiel she'll rather regret that ticket."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What was Lostwithiel saying all this time in that gentle baritone,
which was heard only by one listener? He was asking forgiveness for
his indiscretion of the afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> in that prayer for pardon was
repeating his offence. Isola was less inclined to be angry, perhaps,
now. The magic of the dance was still upon her senses, the dance which
had brought them nearer than all the days they had met; than all their
long confidential conversations on the heights above the harbour,
or on the river path, or dawdling on the bridge. She had felt the
beating of his heart against her own, breath mingling with breath, the
thrilling touch of his encircling arm; and it was as if he had woven
a spell around her which made her his. She had never danced with her
husband, who had no love of that heathenish art. In all their brisk,
frank courtship there had been no intoxicating hours. She hardly
knew what dancing meant till she waltzed with Lostwithiel, who had
something of the fiery ardour of a Pagan worshipping his gods in wild
gyrations upon moonlit mountain or in secret cave. She let him talk
to her to-night&mdash;let him pour out the full confession of his unhappy
love. He spoke not as one who had hope; not with that implied belief in
her frailty which would have startled her into prompt resistance. His
accents were the accents of despair, his love was a dark fatality.</p>

<p class="center">
ἉΝΑΓΚΗ
</p>

<p>"Why did you write that word?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why? Because I could not give you back that card without some token
of my passion&mdash;with only commonplace entries which Jones, Brown, and
Robinson might write there. I want you to feel that you belong to me,
somehow, in some way, as the spirits of the dead and the souls of the
living belong to each other sometimes, by links which none can see.
When I am at the other end of the earth I want to feel that there is
something, if it were only a word, like a masonic sign, between us; if
it were only a promise that in such or such a phase of the waning moon
we would each look up and breathe the other's name."</p>

<p>"You are going away?"</p>

<p>"What else can I do? Can I stay? You tell me I made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> you miserable by
what I said this afternoon. That means we must meet no more. I can't be
sorry for my offence. I cannot answer for myself. My love has passed
the point of sanity and self-control. I have no option. I must offend
you, or I must leave you."</p>

<p>"You need not leave Trelasco," she said gently. "I am going away
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Going away! Where?"</p>

<p>"To London first, and then to India."</p>

<p>"To Burmah? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"If not to the front, to the nearest convenient station. I am going to
my husband; as nearly as I can reach him; and as quickly as I can make
the journey."</p>

<p>"You are dreaming."</p>

<p>"No, I have quite made up my mind. I hated to be left behind last year;
and now that his return is deferred my only chance of happiness is
to go to him. Some one called me a grass widow the other day. What a
detestable name!"</p>

<p>"Give me this one waltz?" he asked, without any comment upon her
intended journey.</p>

<p>"Impossible. I told them all I shouldn't dance any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, your partners are all in the supper-room, I dare say. The dancing
men go in last. Hark! it's the Myosotis. Just one turn&mdash;only one."</p>

<p>He had risen from his low seat, and she rose involuntarily at the sound
of the opening bars. He put his arm round her gently, and drew her into
the ball-room, waltzing slowly as they went, and then, with the sudden
impetus of an enthusiastic dancer, he was whirling her round the room,
and she know nothing, cared for nothing, in the confusion of light and
melody.</p>

<p>"Think of me sometimes when you are far away!" he whispered, with his
lips almost touching her forehead.</p>

<p>She did not resent that whisper. Already, within a dozen hours of his
first offence, she had grown accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> to his words of love. It
seemed to her as if they had loved each other for years&mdash;had loved and
had despaired long ago, in some dim half-remembered past. A passion of
this kind is like a dream, in which an instant gives the impression of
half a lifetime, of long memories and old habit.</p>

<p>The room was much clearer now.</p>

<p>"Is it very late?" asked Isola.</p>

<p>"About four."</p>

<p>"So late&mdash;and I told the flyman half-past two. It is dreadful. Let us
stop, please."</p>

<p>He obeyed, and went with her towards the cloak-room. The seats were
nearly empty now where the matrons had sat in their velvet and brocade,
a gorgeous background to the clouds of tulle and sylph-like figures of
the dancers. Mrs. Baynham was nowhere to be seen, and the diminished
bundles of tabby-cat cloaks and Shetland shawls in the cloak-room
indicated that a good many people had left. Isola put on her soft white
shawl hurriedly, and went out into the hall, where Lostwithiel had gone
to look for her carriage.</p>

<p>People were going away very fast, and through the open doorway there
was a sound of voices and wheels; but, in spite of footmen, constables,
and hangers-on, there seemed a prodigious difficulty in getting any
particular carriage to the door.</p>

<p>It was a mild, misty night, and the moon, which had been counted on for
the return home, was hidden behind a mass of black clouds&mdash;or in the
expressive phraseology of one of the foxhunters, had gone to ground.
Mrs. Disney waited near the door while Lostwithiel searched for her
fly. There were several departures of other muffled figures, features
undistinguishable behind Shetland wraps, or furry hoods, as the men
hustled their womenkind into the carriages. It seemed an age to Isola,
waiting there alone in the corridor, and seeing no mortal whom she knew
among those passersby, before Lostwithiel came, hurried and breathless,
to say that her carriage was just coming up to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wrap your shawl round your head," he said quickly, as he gave her his
arm. "There's a nasty damp fog&mdash;so," muffling her, almost to blindness.
"Come along."</p>

<p>She looked at the carriage, with its lamps shining red against the grey
mistiness like great fiery eyes, and then, glancing at the horse, she
cried suddenly, "I'm afraid that's the wrong fly. I think mine had a
grey horse."</p>

<p>"No, no, it's all right. Pray don't loiter in this chilling air."</p>

<p>The carriage door was open, the constable standing by, bull's-eye in
hand, a pair of horses snorting close behind, another carriage coming
up so near that the pole threatened destruction. There was no time for
loitering. Everybody was in a hurry to get home. Isola stepped lightly
into the brougham, which drove slowly off.</p>

<p>"Next carriage, Mrs. Brune Prideaux," roared the constable. "Mrs.
Prideaux' carriage stops all the way."</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></p>

<p class="center">"A LOVE STILL BURNING UPWARD."</p>


<p>It was early summer, summer in her first youth, when she is frivolous
and capricious, laughs and weeps she knows not why; smiling through
her tears, and never knowing her own mind for a week together; to-day
gracious-tempered and tropical; to-morrow east-windy and morose. In
a word, it was June, a season of roses and rains, blue skies and
thunder-clouds. It was June, and Martin Disney was looking out of the
window with a keen eager face, much bronzed, and somewhat haggard,
after a fatiguing campaign, looking out across the vales and woods of
his native county, as the Penzance train sped along the high-level line
betwixt Plymouth and Par. Those keen, grey eyes of his, accustomed to
searching out far-off objects, looked as if they could pierce through
the green heart of the Cornish valleys to the sheltered little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> harbour
of Fowey and the blue sea that opened wide to the far-off West.</p>

<p>His labours were over, and he was going to take his rest, going to hang
up his sword, that sword which had done such good work, or to transform
it into a reaping-hook. He was Colonel Disney now, had given the State
his best service, and now, in the very prime and vigour of his manhood,
the State had done with him, and he was free to do what he listed with
the maturer half of his life. He would have been very sorry to retire
from active service had it not been for that tender tie which gave such
sweetness to the thought of retirement and tranquil days. He was going
home. The word thrilled him like music; home to his fair young wife,
his chosen one, his domestic divinity. He had not left off wondering
how it had ever come to pass that so young and fair a creature could
care for him.</p>

<p>"It isn't as if I were one of your accomplished fellows," he said to
himself, "able to sing, or play the flute, or paint in water-colours.
Except a very earnest love of a few good books, I have no culture. How
can any girl in the present day care for a man without culture? I could
never appreciate Keats, for instance; and not to appreciate Keats is to
be an outsider in literature."</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of his seven and forty years, in spite of his
deficiencies, his homeliness, that young heart had gone out to him.
She loved him, and his lot was full. There was nothing more upon
God's earth that he could desire, were it not a miracle, and that the
mother he had so fondly loved might be given back to him, to share his
happiness, to make the third in a trinity of trusting love. Since that
could not be, there was nothing left for him to yearn for.</p>

<p>The beating of his heart quickened almost unbearably, as the train drew
near Par. Isola would meet him at the Junction, perhaps. He had not
announced the actual hour of his arrival, for matters had been a little
uncertain when he wrote yesterday, and he had not cared to telegraph
this morning before he left Paddington. Yet she would know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> that this
was the only likely train for him to choose; and she would be at the
Junction, he thought, smiling her glad welcome, a fair young face,
rosy in the sunset; for it was evening as he drew near the end of his
journey.</p>

<p>No; there was nobody he knew at the Junction. He walked up and down the
platform, and stared about him in rather a forlorn way during the few
minutes before the starting of the train for Fowey. She had not come to
anticipate their meeting by an hour or so, as he had hoped, as he had
felt almost certain, she would come.</p>

<p>It was more natural that she should wait and receive him at the
Angler's Nest, he told himself, sitting in the corner of the railway
carriage presently, in a train of three coaches, steaming through the
pretty picturesque country between Par and Fowey. In the colder light
of reason it seemed preposterous to have expected to see her at the
Junction. She would like to welcome him amidst her own surroundings,
in the home to which she had doubtless given those little beautifying
touches in honour of his coming, which are such delight to women, and
which sometimes pass altogether unobserved by that pachydermatous
animal, man! How slowly the engine moved along that little bit of
line! Martin Disney sat with his face to the wind, and snuffed the sea
breeze as if it had been the odour of home. He thought of Ulysses,
and his return from distant lands. Would Tim, the fox terrier, know
him? and Shah, the Persian cat? Perhaps not. Tim was no Argus; vastly
affectionate and demonstrative, but not a dog to expire at one's
feet, in the rapture of his master's return. Penelope would know him,
and welcome him. That was enough for this modern Ulysses, who had no
reason to disguise himself in re-entering his home&mdash;who had no fear
of rival suitors, or interlopers of any kind. Penelope would welcome
him, and trusty Tabitha. He thought of the old servant's honest face
with delight. She was something left to him out of boyhood and youth.
He felt like a young man when he talked to her. She was the one strong
link betwixt the present and the past. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> was his memory embodied.
He could refer to her as to a dictionary of days long gone. When did
we do such and such a thing&mdash;or go to such a place? What was the name
of the bay horse I bought at Plympton? Where did my mother pick up the
Sheraton secretaire? Tabitha could answer all such trivial questions:
and Tabitha could talk to him for hours of his mother's words and
ways&mdash;of the things that were only history.</p>

<p>At last! The train crept into the little station, nestling on the edge
of a wood, and there was Fowey, homely, friendly little Fowey, so
strange and yet so familiar; strange to eyes that had so lately looked
upon the cities of the East; familiar to the man who had been reared in
the neighbourhood, whose first impressions of God's earth had stamped
harbour and hills upon his brain, like an indelible picture. There was
Masters's fly, an eminently respectable vehicle that never touted for
chance passengers, waiting for him. He was expected, evidently.</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Disney send you?" he asked the driver.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>How thoughtful of the young wife, who might be forgiven if she had
left such a small duty unfulfilled. Yet he would have liked to see her
sweet self at the station&mdash;only, as he had argued with himself just
now, it would have discounted the home-welcome. It would have been an
anti-climax.</p>

<p>Dearly as he loved that home river, and those fertile hills, and
beautiful as they were after their kind, they could but seem small
and tame to eyes that had looked upon the glories of the East. Disney
contemplated the scene with a touch of sad surprise, wondering at this
miniature loveliness; recalling the day when those steep hillsides,
where the red cattle were grazing in the mists of eventide, had seemed
grand in his sight. Now they had a kind of pitiful prettiness. His
heart yearned towards them with compassion for their insignificance.</p>

<p>For nearly two years he had been moving about with his company in the
land of jungle and mountain, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> that vast table-land through which
the Salween river runs down to the Gulf of Martaban; and after those
wider horizons, he found himself in a narrow road, shut in by grassy
hills, and hugging the margin of a silver thread that called itself a
river.</p>

<p>There is always a tinge of melancholy in that hour after sundown; and
Martin Disney's heart saddened a little as he looked at the quiet
river, and the shadows on the hillside&mdash;that pale mistiness of summer
evening which gives a ghostly touch to all things, as if it were a
brief revelation of a spirit world. It is an hour at which even a
strong man's heart is apt to sink with a vague sense of fear.</p>

<p>The fly drew up at the little wooden gate between high hedges of
escalonia, with glossy leaves and bright red blossom. A slender figure
in a white gown was visible on the threshold, as Disney sprang out of
the fly, and while the flyman was lifting down the luggage, that airy
form flitted across the lawn, and Colonel Disney's wife was standing
shyly within the open gate, almost as if she had come out to receive a
stranger.</p>

<p>He could not clasp her to his breast before a flyman; but he
seized both her hands, gripped them convulsively, and then led her
towards the house, leaving Masters's man to deal as he pleased with
portmanteaux and hat-box, gun-case and umbrella-case, despatch-box,
and other chattels; to leave them out in the lane to the dews and the
night-birds, if he so listed. Martin Disney had no consciousness of
anything in this world except the woman by his side.</p>

<p>"My darling! my darling!" he ejaculated, in a choked voice, "how I have
longed for this hour, with a longing that has been almost madness!"</p>

<p>And then he saw for the first time that her face was as white as her
gown. Was it the twilight that made her look so pale? Could he wonder
if the emotion of this supreme moment blanched that young cheek, when
he, soldier and wayfarer upon the world's roughest roads, felt like a
child, striving to hold back his tears?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Lamps were burning in dining-room and drawing-room. He saw the table
laid for dinner through the open door as he and Isola passed by; but
the idea of eating and drinking seemed very far off just now. They went
into the drawing-room together, where a solitary lamp was shining upon
a table crowded with flowers, and where the scents of the garden came
in through the open window. Here he satisfied the longing of his hungry
heart, and took that fragile form in his arms, and kissed the pale cold
lips. She lay upon his breast unresistingly; helpless, unresponsive,
like a dead thing.</p>

<p>"Isola, have you forgotten that you once loved me?"</p>

<p>"Forgotten! No, no, no! There is no one in the world so good and true
as you are. I love you with all my heart and soul."</p>

<p>Her face was hidden on his breast, but she lifted up her arms and
clasped them round his neck. He seated himself in his accustomed
chair&mdash;it was standing where it had always stood before he went
away&mdash;and took her upon his knee, as if she had been a child. Then a
great storm of sobs suddenly burst from throat and bosom, a flood of
tears streamed upon his breast, and he felt her arms trembling as they
clasped his neck.</p>

<p>"My own dear love," he murmured gently, "one would almost think you
were sorry I have came back."</p>

<p>She could not answer him at first for her sobs, but she shook her
head, and at last the words, "No, no, no," came from her lips; and he
kissed and calmed her with almost fatherly gentleness. And then they
went into the dining-room, where the soup-tureen was waiting for them
on the sideboard, with a neat little parlour-maid&mdash;not Susan, but
another&mdash;ready to minister to them.</p>

<p>The table had been decorated by Isola's own hands. Dark crimson roses
were lying on the fair white damask; one tall glass stood in the centre
with three slim golden lilies, pale and heavy-headed, which filled the
room with perfume. These came from one of the hothouses at Glenaveril,
whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> good-natured Mrs. Crowther had sent a basket of exotics in
honour of the colonel's return. The lamplight, the flowers, the pretty
old Wedgwood service of creamy white and dull brown, made up a feast
for Martin Disney's eye, after a life spent mostly under canvas. He
looked from the gaily adorned table to the face beside him, pallid and
pinched, despite its sweetness.</p>

<p>"My dear one, you are looking very ill," he said, with an anxious air.</p>

<p>"What an ungallant speech!" she answered, smiling at him with
unexpected gaiety. "I have been fretting at your long, long absence,
and you reproach me for my deteriorated appearance. Never mind, Martin,
you will see how rosy and bright I shall get now our parting has come
to an end."</p>

<p>"Yes, love, we must coax the roses back to your cheeks. I must have a
good mount ready for you when the cubbing begins, and a few morning
gallops will soon make a change in my fragile wife's appearance. And
I'll charter a yacht and steep you in ozone."</p>

<p>"Oh, one gets enough of that on shore, there is no need to go further."</p>

<p>"But I thought you adored yachting? It was one of our grand schemes
for the future, to hire a modest little yawl and go round the coast to
Clovelly. Have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>"No, no; only I don't want you to waste your money&mdash;and, if we start a
bigger stable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't know what a Cr&oelig;sus I have become. You needn't be
afraid of ruining me. My poor lonely little wife. Why didn't you send
for Allegra?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't have been of any good to me. She is all that is sweet
and lovable, and she is your sister; but she wouldn't have filled your
vacant place. I should have only felt lonelier for having to talk every
day, and pretend a kind of happiness. Being alone, I could bury myself
in a book, and forget my troubles."</p>

<p>"This soup doesn't look up to Tabitha's old form. Do you know that
among other delights of this earthly paradise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> I have been looking
forward to Tabitha's little dinners. I don't believe there is a <i>chef</i>
in Paris who can cook so well as that self-taught genius, who ripened
into perfection by a process of gradual evolution, from the early days
when my mother discovered that nobody could make arrowroot or cook a
mutton cutlet as well as Tabitha. By-the-by, why has not that good soul
shown herself? I thought she would have disputed with you for my first
kiss."</p>

<p>While he ran on in this fashion, Isola sat looking down at the
table-cloth, pallid no longer, but crimson.</p>

<p>"Tabitha has gone!" she said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Tabitha gone&mdash;for a holiday?"</p>

<p>"No, she has left me, altogether."</p>

<p>"Left you&mdash;altogether?" exclaimed Disney, with the tone of a man who
could scarcely believe in his own sense of hearing, so astounding was
the statement that met his ears. "Tabitha, my mother's faithful old
servant, who was like my own flesh and blood! What in God's name made
her leave you? Did you quarrel with her?"</p>

<p>He asked the question almost sternly. For the first time in his life
he was angry with this dear fragile creature, the idol of his heart.
He had loved Tabitha as servants are not often loved. He had left his
young wife in her charge, desiring no better custodian, full of faith
in Tabitha's ability both to protect and counsel her girlish mistress.</p>

<p>"No, no; we did not quarrel. I liked Tabitha very much. I was almost as
fond of her as you yourself could be."</p>

<p>"And yet you dismissed her!" Disney retorted bitterly. "She was not
smart enough for you, perhaps. Those Crowther people may have put it
into your head that she was old-fashioned&mdash;that you could never have a
modish household with such a humdrum old person at the head of it. Was
that your motive?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Martin, how can you think me so frivolous? I hate smartness
and pretension as much as you do. No, I should never have dismissed
Tabitha. She left me of her own accord."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She wanted rest. She was too old for service, she told me. I tried
to keep her. I humiliated myself so far as to beg her to stay
with me"&mdash;the tears came into her eyes at the mere memory of that
humiliation&mdash;"but she had made up her mind. She would not give way."</p>

<p>"Where did she go?"</p>

<p>"To Falmouth&mdash;to live with her sister, a shoemaker's widow. They let
lodgings, I believe."</p>

<p>"She must have gone mad! A lodging-house must be harder work than
anything she had to do here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it must."</p>

<p>"When did she go?"</p>

<p>"At the beginning of the year&mdash;in January."</p>

<p>"She left you six months ago, and in all that time you never told me
she was gone."</p>

<p>"I did not want you to know, for fear you should be worried or vexed."</p>

<p>"I should have been both; but you ought to have told me. I had a right
to know. I left you in her charge, Isola. You are much too young and
too pretty to be living alone without some kind of dragon&mdash;and I knew
Tabitha would be a very gentle dragon&mdash;a good motherly soul, able to
wait upon you and look after your health, and yet grim enough to keep
marauders off the premises. Indeed, my pet, you should have let me know
of her departure without an hour's delay. She was very wrong to go. It
was a breach of faith I could never have expected."</p>

<p>"Pray don't be angry with her, Martin."</p>

<p>"But I am angry. I have a right to be angry. I'll go to Falmouth
to-morrow, and have it out with her."</p>

<p>"No, no, pray don't! We parted good friends. She can say nothing to you
more than she said to me. Pray don't let there be any bad blood between
you. What could be gained by your going? To-morrow, too&mdash;our first day
together!"</p>

<p>"Well, it shall not be till the day after; but go I must.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> To-morrow
I will revel in the delights of home, and my dear one's society.
To-morrow I will be drunken with joy. The day after will do for
Tabitha."</p>

<p>"I think it is making a great deal too much of her to go to Falmouth on
purpose to see her," said Isola, with a grain of pettiness; and then,
after a pause, during which the colonel had been trying to appease
a sharp appetite with the muscular leg of an elderly fowl, she said
nervously&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are not enjoying your dinner."</p>

<p>"What do I care for dinner on such a night as this; but, as a matter
of plain truth, I must say that your new cook is a very bad substitute
for Tabitha. Her soup was watery, her fish was greasy, her poultry
is hardly eatable. If she has talents in any other line she is
keeping them in reserve for another day. It may be that she excels in
made-dishes&mdash;a misfortune for me, as I never eat them."</p>

<p>"I had a splendid character with her," said Isola, piteously, with the
helpless feeling of a housewife who sees before her a dark prospect of
bad dinners and marital grumblings, or the agonizing wrench involved in
changing her cook.</p>

<p>"Yes, my love, people generally give splendid characters to servants
they want to get rid of," answered Disney, dryly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These wedded lovers went out very early next morning to explore
the gardens and meadows; Isola eager to point out various small
improvements which she had made with the help of the old gardener, who
would have plunged his hand and arm into a fiery furnace to procure
plant or flower which his young mistress desired. Sweet words and sweet
looks go very far in this world. They are a mighty revenue, and will
often do their owner as good service as gold and silver.</p>

<p>Isola had worked in the garden with her own hands ever since the
beginning of spring, the first tender opening of Earth's heavy eyelids,
her first pale smile of snowdrops, her broad laughter of daffodils, her
joyous peal of bluebells, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> riotous mirth of May blossom. She had
toiled in the sweat of her brow so that the garden might be beautiful
at mid-summer: for early in March there had come a letter full of
rejoicing from that distant hill-kingdom, and she knew that the year
of absence to which she had looked so hopelessly last November was
commuted to half a year.</p>

<p>Martin Disney was full of admiration for his wife's improvements. The
old-fashioned borders were brimming over with old-world flowers; the
shrubberies had grown out of knowledge; the escalonia hedge by the
kitchen garden was a thing to wonder at.</p>

<p>"I remember the hedge at Tregenna Castle before that good old place was
an inn," said Martin; and then, having admired everything, he walked
up and down the grass beside the laurel hedge with his wife&mdash;while
the Satan-sent cook was spoiling the food that bounteous Nature had
provided for man's enjoyment&mdash;and questioned her about the life she had
been leading in his absence.</p>

<p>"You used to write me such good letters, dearest, so full of detail,
that I knew exactly how your days were spent, and could picture every
hour of your life: but of late your descriptive powers have flagged. I
dare say you got tired of writing long letters to a dull old fellow in
India, who could never write you a clever letter in reply. It must have
seemed a one-sided business?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no, dear. Your letters had only one fault. They were never
half long enough; but I knew how busy you were, and I thought it was so
good of you never to miss a mail."</p>

<p>"Good of me! Had there been twice as many mails I would not have
willingly missed one. But there is no doubt your letters fell off after
last autumn. They were sweet, and ever welcome to me&mdash;but they told me
very little."</p>

<p>"There was very little to tell."</p>

<p>"Ah, but in the old days you used to make it seem so much. You had
such a delightful way of describing trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> events. I thought at one
time you had the makings of a Jane Austen; but afterwards I began to
fear you must be out of health. Your letters had a low-spirited tone.
There were no more of those sharp little touches which used to make me
laugh, no more of those tiny word-pictures, which brought the faces and
figures of my old neighbours before me."</p>

<p>"You can hardly wonder if my spirits sank a little when you had been so
long away. And then life seemed so death-like in its monotony. There
were days when I felt I might just as well have been dead. There could
be very little difference between lying under the earth and crawling
listlessly on the top of it."</p>

<p>"You were too much alone, Isola," he answered, distressed at this
revelation. "You ought to have sent for Allegra. I begged you to send
for her, if you felt dull."</p>

<p>"Do you think she could have cured my dulness?" exclaimed his wife,
impatiently. "Life would have seemed still more tiresome if I had been
obliged to talk when there was nothing to talk about, and to smile when
I felt inclined to cry."</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't know what a companion Allegra is&mdash;brimming over with
fun! She knows her Dickens by heart; and I never met with anybody who
appreciated him as intensely as she does."</p>

<p>"I don't care about Dickens."</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;care&mdash;about Dickens!"</p>

<p>He echoed her words as if almost paralyzed by horror.</p>

<p>"Not as I used to care. One's taste changes as life goes on. Lately I
have read nothing but Victor Hugo, and Keats, and Shelley."</p>

<p>"Very well in their way, but not half cheery enough for a lonely little
woman beside the Fowey river. You ought to have had Allegra. It would
have been better for you and better for her. She is tired of the Art
school; and the other pupils are tired of her. They are very fond of
her; but she has done all the work twice over, and there is nothing
more for her to do, unless we meant her to enter the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> Academy
and go in seriously for art, Mrs. Meynell tells me. According to that
lady's account my sister must be an Admirable Crichton in petticoats."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt she is very clever and very nice; but, as I could not
have you, I preferred being alone," answered Isola.</p>

<p>She was walking slowly by his side along the closely shaven grass,
and every now and then she stretched out a hand that looked
semi-transparent, and gathered a flower at random, and then plucked
off its petals nervously as she walked on. Her eyelids were lowered,
and her lips were tightly set. Martin could but think there was a vein
of obstinacy in this bewitching wife of his&mdash;a gentle resistance which
would tend to make him her slave rather than her master in the days to
come. He saw with pain that her cheeks were hollow and pinched, and
that her complexion had a sickly whiteness. She had fretted evidently
in those long months of solitude, and it would take time to bring back
the colour and gaiety to her face. As for dulness, well, no doubt Fowey
was ever so much duller than Dinan, where there were officers and
tennis-parties and afternoon tea-drinkings, and a going and coming of
tourists all the summer through, and saints' days, and processions, and
<i>fêtes</i> and illuminations in the market square, beneath the statue of
Duguesclin.</p>

<p>"And how did the world use you, Isola?" he asked presently. "Was
everybody kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, people were very kind; especially Mrs. Baynham and Mrs.
Crowther. They sent me ever so many invitations, and wanted me to go on
their day every week."</p>

<p>"And I hope you accepted their invitations."</p>

<p>"I went to Mrs. Baynham's sometimes on her day; but I didn't care about
going to Glenaveril. It is all too grand and too fine&mdash;and I don't like
Mr. Crowther."</p>

<p>"He was always courteous to you, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he was particularly courteous. I have no reason for disliking
him. He is my Dr. Fell&mdash;the reason why I cannot tell, but I would walk
a mile to avoid meeting him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we will not cultivate social relations with Glenaveril. We will
visit at no house where my dearest does not feel happy and at ease. And
as for the finery, I agree with you, there is something too much of it.
I like powder and plush when the people they serve are to the manner
born, and when powder and plush seem more natural than parlour-maids;
but I don't care for the solemn stateliness of a big establishment when
it has been newly set up&mdash;at least, not by such folks as the Crowthers.
There are some men to whom such surroundings seem natural, even though
fortune has come late in life. Is the beautiful Belinda married yet?"</p>

<p>"No. I do not think she is as much as engaged."</p>

<p>"I thought Lostwithiel would have married her. She would have been a
grand catch for him, and no doubt she would have snapped at a coronet,
even without strawberry leaves. But I hear he is in South America
orchid-hunting. He was always a capricious individual. There goes the
gong for breakfast. I hope your cook can fry a rasher and boil an egg
better than she can dress a dinner."</p>

<p>They went in together to the pretty dining-room, so bright with books
and flowers, and a life-sized girlish head in water-colours, by Dobson,
R.A., over the chimney-piece, and Venetian glass here and there, that
all characteristics of the ordinary eating-room were effaced, and only
a sense of homeliness and artistic surroundings was left. Isola had
been down at six, and her own hands had given the finishing touches to
the room, and the flowers were of that morning's gathering, and had the
dew and the perfume of morning upon them. The room was so pretty, and
Isola was so much prettier than the room, that a husband would have
been of very dull clay had he troubled himself about the handiwork
of the cook. Martin Disney was not made of dull clay, and he ate an
overdone rasher and a hard-boiled egg without a murmur, and then set
out for a long ramble with Isola.</p>

<p>They went up to the hill upon whose landward slope stood Lostwithiel's
old grey manor-house, with its gardens and park. Isola had not been
there since that never-to-be-for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>gotten November evening when she
met Lostwithiel in the rain. She had avoided the spot from that time
forward, though she had no especial reason for avoidance, since there
was no one there but Mrs. Mayne and her underlings. Lostwithiel and the
<i>Vendetta</i> had sailed away into space directly after the Hunt Ball, and
little had been heard of him save that dim rumour of orchid-hunting on
the shores of the Amazon, which had filtered from the society papers
down to Fowey, <i>viâ</i> the <i>Western Daily Mercury</i>.</p>

<p>Isola and her husband lingered for a long time upon the hilltop, he
revelling in the familiar beauty of that magnificent stretch of cliff
and sea, out to the dim slate colour of the Dodman Point, bay beyond
bay, curving away towards Falmouth and the Lizard&mdash;while between that
hill and the sea lay a world of fertile meadows and bright green
cornfields, of hill and hollow, wood and common, copse and garden, a
rich and smiling country, a land of summer flowers and plenteous growth.</p>

<p>"I never stand upon this hill without feeling proud of being a
Cornishman," said Disney, "and yet, after all, it is a foolish thing to
be proud of an accident. My little Breton girl might as well be proud
of being a countrywoman of Duguesclin's."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I had been born anywhere else I should not have been
so ready to fall in love with a soldier," answered Isola. "I was
brought up to think a knight and a warrior the one ideal: and so I was
fascinated by the first soldier who took any notice of me."</p>

<p>"But were you really fascinated, and were you really in love,"
exclaimed Disney, infinitely delighted at this little speech of his
wife's, "in love with a battered campaigner&mdash;or did you just think you
liked me a little bit, only because you wanted to get away from Dinan?"</p>

<p>"I really&mdash;really&mdash;really loved you," she answered softly, looking up
at him with eyes dimmed by tears, as he drew her nearer to him in his
gladness. "I was not tired of Dinan&mdash;or my life there&mdash;and my heart
went out to you at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> once, because you were good and noble, and seemed
to care for me."</p>

<p>"There was no seeming in it, Isola. I was knocked over at once, like a
pigeon out of a trap. I had been in love with you three weeks&mdash;three
centuries it seemed&mdash;before I could screw up my courage so far as to
think of proposing for you. And then if Hazelrigg hadn't helped me with
your father, I don't suppose I should ever have broken the ice. But
when he&mdash;the colonel&mdash;showed himself so frank and willing&mdash;and the way
was all made smooth for me from a domestic point of view&mdash;and when I
saw that kind little look in your eyes, and the shy little smile&mdash;yes,
you are smiling so now&mdash;I took heart of grace, and stormed the citadel.
Do you remember the evening I asked you to be my wife, Isola; that
starlit night when I had been dining with your people, and you and
Gwendolen, and Hazelrigg and I went out upon the terrace to look at the
stars, and the river, and the twinkling lights of the boats down by the
quay, and the diligence driving over the bridge, deep, deep down in the
valley below us? Do you remember how I lured you away from the other
two, and how we stood under the vine-leaves in the berceau, and I found
the words somehow&mdash;feeblest, stupidest words, I'm afraid&mdash;to make you
know that all the happiness of my life to come depended upon winning
you for my wife?"</p>

<p>"I remember as if it were last night," she answered gravely. "But oh,
how long ago it seems!"</p>

<p>"Why do you sigh as you say that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, one always sighs for the past! How can one help feeling sorry that
it should be gone&mdash;so much of our lives and of ourselves gone for ever?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but when the future is so fair, when the present is so happy,
there should be no more sighing. It is an offence against the Great
Father of all, who has been so good to us."</p>

<p>She did not answer, and they remained silent for some minutes, she
seated on a bank covered with heather and wild flowers; he stretched
on the short, sweet turf at her feet. The heather had not begun to
show its purple bloom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> but there was the gold of the gorse, and the
brightness of innumerable wild flowers around and about them as they
basked in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Dearest, do you believe in dreams?" Disney asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;not much&mdash;dreams are often dreadful," she answered, with a
startled air.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in them a bit," he said, lifting himself into a
sitting position, and addressing himself to her with increasing
earnestness, "not now that I have you here safe within reach of my
hand&mdash;so," taking her hand in his, and keeping it clasped in both his
own; "but I had a dream about you in Burmah, which kept me in a fever
of anxiety for nearly a month. I should have telegraphed to ask if
all was right with you, only I told myself that if anything was wrong
Tabitha would instantly telegraph to me. I made her promise that before
I left England. It was almost my last injunction. And to think that she
left you half a year ago, and that anything might have happened to you
after that, and that there was no one&mdash;no one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, you see, I am quite safe. There was no bad news to send you.
Besides, if I had been ill, or anything had gone wrong, there was Mrs.
Baynham. She has been like a mother to me. I am so sorry you feel vexed
about Tabitha's leaving me."</p>

<p>"Doubly vexed, dear, because you left me in ignorance of the fact."</p>

<p>"Pray don't be angry with me, Martin, so soon," she pleaded meekly.</p>

<p>"Angry, no. I am not angry. I don't know how to be angry with you,
Isola; but I can't help being distressed. However, let the past be
past. I shall never leave you to the care of strangers again till I
die."</p>

<p>Her only answer was to bend her head down to kiss the hands that
clasped her own.</p>

<p>"Tell me about your dream," she said, after a pause, with her forehead
still resting on his hands, and her face hidden. "Was it something very
awful?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was all confusion&mdash;a wild chaos&mdash;a nightmare of strange sounds and
sensations&mdash;tempest, fire, earthquake&mdash;I know not what&mdash;but it meant
deadly danger for you&mdash;death perhaps. I saw you hanging in space&mdash;a
white figure, with piteous, pain-wrought face. Never have I seen you
look like that&mdash;your eyes staring wildly as if they were looking at
death; your features drawn and rigid, and through all the confusion,
and noise, and ceaseless movement, I was trying to follow you&mdash;trying,
but impotently&mdash;to save you. The white figure was always before me&mdash;far
off&mdash;yet visible every now and then across the darkness of a world
where everything was shapeless and confused. But the worst of all was
that every now and then a black wall rose up between your distant
figure and the stony difficult path that I was treading&mdash;a wall against
which I flung myself, mad with rage and despair, trying to tear the
stones asunder with my hands, till the blood ran in streams from my
fingers. It was a dream that seemed to last through a long night,
holding in it the memory of a painful past; yet I suppose it was like
other dreams&mdash;momentary, for I had heard three o'clock strike before I
fell asleep, and when I sounded my repeater it was only a quarter past."</p>

<p>"Rather a meaningless dream," she said, in a sleepy voice, without
looking up. "I don't think it ought to have alarmed you."</p>

<p>"Ah, it sounds meaningless to you; but to me it was full of meaning!
The idea of danger to you was so intense&mdash;so real. The cold sweat of
deadly fear was on my face when I awoke, and it was some minutes before
I could get my senses clear of that ghastly horror, before I could
realize where I was, and that the thing I had seen was a dream. That
stone wall seemed still in front of me, and I had still the feeling
that you were on the other side of it, in ever-increasing peril."</p>

<p>"It was a horrid dream, certainly; but, you see, it had no meaning."</p>

<p>"There were such strange things mixed up in it&mdash;thunder and lightning,
a roaring wind, a sound of rushing waters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> and then, amidst wind and
thunder, there rose the dark barrier that shut out everything."</p>

<p>"Was it long ago that you dreamt this horrid dream?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a long while. It was just before Christmas. I made a note of the
dream in my journal&mdash;wrote it down in fear and trembling, lest there
should be some kind of fulfilment. But then came your letter&mdash;written
at the beginning of January, with your description of the ball&mdash;and I
laughed at my folly in brooding so long upon that phantasmal picture. I
remember, by the way, it was two or three nights after your ball that I
dreamt my dream, while you no doubt were sleeping just a little sounder
than usual after your gaieties."</p>

<p>"Dreams are very strange," said Isola, absently. "I wonder whether
there is any good in them to counterbalance so much pain?"</p>

<p class="center">"LOOK THROUGH MINE EYES WITH THINE, TRUE WIFE."</p>


<p>There were steamers plying between Fowey and Falmouth in this summer
weather, and Colonel Disney suggested next morning that Isola should go
with him on his journey in search of Tabitha. They would go by water
and return in the afternoon by rail. The morning was lovely, and the
trip round the coast would be delightful.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see Tabitha," Isola answered, with a touch of
impatience. "If you are so bent upon seeing her I had rather you went
alone."</p>

<p>"But I had rather not spend a whole day away from you. As for Tabitha,
a visit of ten minutes will be quite enough for me. I have brought her
a Rhampoor Chuddah&mdash;a warm red one. I have only to make her my little
gift, and to say a few words&mdash;without any anger&mdash;about her breach of
faith."</p>

<p>"It was really not a breach of faith. I gave her full permission to go.
I was getting just a little tired of her fussi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>ness. She was not <i>my</i>
old servant, you know, Martin. I had not been used to her all my life,
as you have."</p>

<p>"Ah, but she is so good&mdash;such a thoroughly good woman."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is good, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go to Falmouth together, and you can stop at the Green
Bank, where we can lunch, while I go and find Tabitha. You know her
address, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She lives at No. 5, Crown Terrace, overlooking the harbour."</p>

<p>This conversation took place in the garden, where they breakfasted,
under a square striped awning, an apology for a tent, set up on the
lawn by the river. A badly cooked breakfast seemed less offensive in
the garden, where the summer air, and the perfume of the roses eked out
the meal. After breakfast Disney called his wife to the drawing-room,
where he had brought his spoil from the East, and laid his offerings,
as it were, at the feet of his idol.</p>

<p>"See, love, here is a shawl which you can use as a <i>couvre-pied</i>," he
said, flinging a fine cashmere over a chair, "since Fashion decrees
that women shall wear shawls no more. And here are some ivory chessmen
to assist you in puzzling your brains over the game of Eastern
antiquity; and here are vases and things for odd corners. And I have
brought you a carved Persian screen, and some Peshawur curtains for
your door-ways, and a lamp from Cairo, to make your drawing-room a
little more fantastically pretty. I know you love these things."</p>

<p>She was enraptured with his gifts. Her face lighted up like the face
of a child, and she ran from one object to the other in a confused
gladness, scarcely able to look at one thing at a time.</p>

<p>"They will make the room too lovely," she cried; "and they will tell
everybody of your far-away travels. I can never thank you half enough
for all these treasures."</p>

<p>"Love me a little, and that will be more than enough."</p>

<p>"A little. Ah, Martin, I love you so much."</p>

<p>"Then why do you sigh as you say it? There need be no sighing over our
love now. I never shall leave you again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>He caught her to his breast as he spoke, and kissed the pale sweet
face, with a kind of defiant rapture, as if he challenged Fate to do
him any harm. The pain of separation from that fair young wife had been
so keen an agony that there was a touch of savage exultancy in the joy
of re-union&mdash;some such fierce gladness as a knight-crusader might have
felt in days of old, coming back to his beloved after years of war and
travel.</p>

<p>God help the crusader's wife of those rough days if she had turned from
the path of virtue during his exile. There would be a short shrift and
a bloody shroud for such a sinner!</p>

<p>They walked into Fowey by that pathway which Isola had trodden so often
in the year that was gone&mdash;not always alone. The pleasure steamer was
waiting in the little haven, where the two rivers part under the cloven
hills. Out seaward the air blew fresh and free, and the spray was
dashing up against the rocks, and Polruan's grey roofs were wrapped in
morning shadows while Fowey laughed in the sunshine.</p>

<p>That water journey to Falmouth was delicious upon such a morning, and
it needed not a brass band of three men and a boy, blaring out the new
and popular music-hall song of the year before last, to enliven the
voyage. Those arable lands yonder, undulating with every curve of the
ever-varying coast-line, the emerald green of young corn shining in the
sunlight, copse and spinney here and there in the clefts and hollows,
the Gribbin Head standing up stony and grim on the crest of the topmost
hill, and, anon, Par harbour lying low upon the level sands, and then
this point and that, till they meet the gallant fleet of fishing-boats
sailing out from Mevagissey, like a peaceful Armada, and skim past the
haven, and the little town and quay crowded at the foot of the hill,
and the coastguard's stronghold yonder, high up against the bright blue
sky, whiter than any other mortal habitation ever was or will be. And
so to Falmouth, with porpoises playing under their bows, like sportive
dolphins, as if they carried Dionysius or Arion on their deck&mdash;a brief
summer sail, in the keen sweet air of an English summer. To Martin
Disney's British nostrils that atmosphere seemed soul-inspiring,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> very breath of life and gladness, after the experiences of a
hot-weather campaign.</p>

<p>And here was Falmouth, with proud Pendennis on a sunny height, and
bay and harbour, town and hill, terrace above terrace, tower and
steeple&mdash;the town and streets all crowded and clustered in the
foreground, where the river winds inward to the heart of the land.</p>

<p>The Green Bank gave them cordial welcome, and luncheon was speedily
spread in a private sitting-room, at a snug round table by a window
overlooking the harbour&mdash;luncheon, and of the best, tongue and chicken,
and salad, cherry pasty, junket and cream.</p>

<p>Colonel Disney applied himself to the meal with a hearty relish.</p>

<p>"There is just this one advantage in bad cooking at home that it makes
one so thoroughly enjoy everything one gets abroad," he said, laughing
at his own prowess.</p>

<p>"I'll try and get a better cook, if you like, Martin," Isola said, with
rather a helpless air.</p>

<p>To a wife of one and twenty there seems such futility in worrying about
a cook.</p>

<p>"You couldn't possibly get a worse. How long have you put up with this
one?"</p>

<p>"Ever since Tabitha left."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! You have been starving upon ill-cooked food for six
months. No wonder you look thin and out of health."</p>

<p>"I am really very well. There is nothing the matter with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, there is a great deal the matter. A bad cook, solitude, no
one to watch over you and care for you. But that is all over now. You
are eating no lunch&mdash;not even that superb cherry pasty. I'll be off to
find Tabitha. I shan't be more than half an hour, unless Crown Terrace
is at the extremity of Falmouth. Have you brought a book to read while
I am away? No, foolish child. Never mind. There is the county paper,
and there is the harbour, with all its life, for you to look at."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>He started on his voyage of discovery, with the warm, comfortable
shawl which he had bought for his mother's old servant hanging over
his arm. It was a small disappointment amidst the infinite delight of
his home-coming, but when he bought the shawl he had fancied himself
putting it round Tabitha's ample shoulders in the little housekeeper's
room at the Angler's Nest, a room that was just large enough to hold a
linen cupboard, a Pembroke table, a comfortable armchair, and Tabitha,
who seemed bigger than all the furniture put together.</p>

<p>He was a man of warm affections, and of that constancy of mind and
temper to which forgetfulness of old ties or indifference to past
associations is impossible. Tabitha's image was associated with all the
tenderest memories of his youth; with his mother's widowhood, and with
her second marriage&mdash;a foolish marriage. At seven and thirty years of
age she had taken to herself a second husband, some years her junior,
in the person of George Leland, a well-meaning and highly intellectual
curate with weak lungs, a union entered upon while her only son was
a cadet, and which left her four years later again a widow, with
an infant daughter, a child born amidst sickness and sorrow, and
christened at the father's desire Allegra, as if she had entered a
world of joy. Through that Indian summer of his mother's second love,
in all the cares and griefs of her second marriage, Tabitha had been
trusty and devoted, nursing the frail husband through that last year
of fading life which was one long illness, comforting the widow, and
rearing the sickly baby until it blossomed into a fine healthy child,
whose strength and beauty took every one by surprise.</p>

<p>With all the joys and sorrows of his mother's life Tabitha had been
associated for five and thirty years of conscientious service; and
to have lost the good soul now from his fireside was a positive
affliction to Martin Disney. Her loss gave an air of instability to
his domestic life. Who would ever care for his property as Tabitha had
cared&mdash;Tabitha who had seen the china and the pictures and drawings
collected piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> by piece, who had seen the old family silver drop in
by way of legacy from this and that aunt or uncle, till the safe was
full of treasures, every one of which had its distinct history? What
would a new housekeeper care for General Disney's coffee-pot, for the
George the Second urn that had belonged to his uncle the Indian judge,
for his grandmother's decanter stands? A modern servant would scoff at
decanter stands; would wonder they were not melted down. No, rejoiced
as he was to be at home once more, home without Tabitha would be
something less than home to Martin Disney.</p>

<p>He found Crown Terrace, a row of neat little houses high above the
harbour on the Helston road. He had no need to look at the numbers on
the doors. He knew Tabitha's house at a glance, four or five doors off.
Who else would have devised such pretty window-boxes, so simple and
so artistic; or who else would have hit upon so perfect a harmony of
colour in the flowering plants? Who else, of that lowly status, would
have chosen such curtains or draped them so gracefully? The little
bow-windowed band-box of a house was as pretty as a Parisian toy.</p>

<p>Tabitha was in the window, working with scissors and sponge at one of
the flower-boxes. Never an aphid was allowed to rest on Tabitha's roses
or geraniums. She gave a little cry of mixed alarm and delight as she
saw that stalwart figure come between her and the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Lor' sakes, Captain Martin, is it you?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tabby, it is I&mdash;and I want to know what you've got to say to me.
Do you know how a deserter feels when he suddenly finds himself face to
face with his commanding officer? I never had such a knock-down blow as
when I came home the day before yesterday and found you had deserted
your post&mdash;you whom I trusted so implicitly."</p>

<p>Tabitha looked at him dumbly&mdash;entreatingly&mdash;as if she were mutely
supplicating him not to be angry. She took this reproof with an air of
having thoroughly deserved it, of not having any plea to offer in her
defence.</p>

<p>"You'll come in and sit down a bit, won't you, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> Martin?" she
said deprecatingly; and then, without waiting for an answer, she
bustled out of the parlour, and anon appeared at the open door.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I am coming in. I have a great deal to say to you&mdash;much
more than can be said in the open street."</p>

<p>Tabitha ushered him into the little parlour; so neat, so cool and
dainty a bower, albeit the whole of its contents would scarcely have
realized ten pounds at an auction. She offered him her most luxurious
easy-chair&mdash;a large Madeira chair, with pale chintz cushions and
artistic draping; and then, when he had seated himself, she stood
before him like a prisoner at the bar, and with unmistakable guilt
disturbing the broad placidity of her countenance.</p>

<p>"Tabby, there is my offering from the Indies. May it keep you warm when
you run out upon your mysterious errands on autumn evenings, as you
used to do in my mother's time. Sit down, pray; I have lots to say to
you."</p>

<p>Tabitha received the comfortable gift with rapturous thanks. That
Captain Martin should have thought of her, so far away, with his head
full of fighting, and with death looking him in the face! It was too
much, and the tears rolled down her honest cheeks as she thanked him.</p>

<p>"And now, Tabitha, I want a candid answer to a straight question. Why
did you leave my wife last January?"</p>

<p>"That's easily explained, sir. I'm getting old, and I was tired of
service. Mrs. Disney was very well able to spare me. Perhaps she didn't
set the same value on me as you did. Young people like young faces
about them."</p>

<p>"All that I can understand; but it didn't exonerate you from your duty
to me. You promised me to take care of my young wife."</p>

<p>"I did my best, Captain Martin, as long as I could give satisfaction,"
faltered Tabitha, growing very pale under this reproof.</p>

<p>"Had you any misunderstanding with Mrs. Disney? Did she find fault with
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir. Mrs. Disney is not one to find fault. She's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> too easy, if
anything. No one could be sweeter than she was to me. God knows, if she
had been my own daughter I could not have loved her better than I did."</p>

<p>Here Tabitha broke down altogether, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my good soul, don't distress yourself," cried Disney,
touched by this emotion. "You loved her; you could not help loving her,
could you? And yet you left her."</p>

<p>"I was getting tired and old, sir; and I had saved enough money to
furnish a small house; and my sister, Mrs. David, being a widow without
chick or child, wanted me to join her in a lodging-house at the
seaside. She's a beautiful cook, is my sister, much better than ever I
was. So perhaps I was over-persuaded: and here I am. What's done cannot
be undone, Captain Martin; but if ever Mrs. Disney should be ill or in
grief or trouble, and she should want me, I'll go to her without an
hour's loss of time. I can never forget that she is your wife, and that
she was a kind mistress to me."</p>

<p>Martin Disney breathed more freely after this speech. He had been
curiously disturbed at the idea of a breach between his wife and the
old and faithful servant.</p>

<p>"Well, Tabby, I'm glad at least you and my wife are not ill friends,"
he said. "I do not care for the loosening of old ties. And now I must
be off. Mrs. Disney is waiting for me at the Green Bank."</p>

<p>Tabitha seemed a little startled on hearing that her late mistress was
in Falmouth, but she made no remark upon the fact.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Tabby. Stay, there's one favour you can do me. Get me a good
cook. The woman we have at present would be a blight upon the happiest
home in Christendom."</p>

<p>"I'll find you a better one, sir. I'll set about hunting for a good one
this afternoon."</p>

<p>Martin shook hands with her on the door-step, and she stood watching
him till he disappeared at the turn of the road. She watched him with a
countenance full of sorrow.</p>

<p class="center">MY FROLIC FALCON, WITH BRIGHT EYES.</p>


<p>Everybody in Trelasco and in the neighbourhood seemed glad to see
Colonel Disney again. All the best people within a six-mile drive
came bearing down upon the Angler's Nest in the week that followed
his return; and there were cosy little afternoon tea-drinkings in the
drawing-room, or on the lawn, and Isola had her hands full in receiving
visitors. Everybody congratulated her upon having her hero back from
the wars.</p>

<p>"You ought to be very proud of your husband, Mrs. Disney," said
Vansittart Crowther, with his air of taking all the world under his
protection.</p>

<p>"I have always been proud of him," Isola answered gently. "I was proud
of him before the Burmese War."</p>

<p>"Your poor wife has been looking very unhappy for the last few months,"
Mrs. Crowther said to the colonel, with a motherly glance at Isola. "I
really had a good mind to write to you and beg you to hurry home if you
didn't want to find the poor thing far gone in a decline when you came
back."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Crowther, what nonsense," cried Isola, growing crimson at
this motherly officiousness. "I have never been out of health, or in
the least likely to go into a decline. One cannot always look like a
dairy-maid."</p>

<p>"My dear, there's no use talking, you looked very bad. Had one of my
girls looked as ill, I should have taken her off to Buxton to drink the
waters, without an hour's delay."</p>

<p>That visit of the Crowthers seemed much longer than any other afternoon
call. The Crowthers, husband, and wife, and elder daughter, had an
inquisitorial air, Isola fancied, an air of scrutinizing her house
and herself and her surroundings, which was intolerable to her;
although on Mrs. Crowther's part she knew the scrutiny was made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
utmost benevolence, and the officiousness was the outcome of a nature
overflowing with the milk of human kindness.</p>

<p>"I wish you had written to me, Mrs. Crowther," said Disney. "I couldn't
have come home any sooner, but I could have telegraphed to my sister
Allegra to look after my wife, and cheer her solitude. I was a fool not
to have had her here all along."</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better go out of the room while you are holding your
consultation about me?" exclaimed Isola, fretfully. "It's rather hard
upon the patient to hear her case discussed in cold blood. I am tired
of declaring that I have not been ill, and that it is my misfortune and
not my fault to have a pale complexion."</p>

<p>"You were not always so pallid, my dear," said Mrs. Crowther,
persistently. "You were one of the beauties of the Hunt Ball, and you
had colour enough that night."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dr. and Mrs. Baynham came the following afternoon, and these two told
the same story, though with less obtrusive concern.</p>

<p>"I looked after the young lady now and then," said the worthy doctor,
"and as I found there was nothing radically wrong, I didn't worry
you with any low-spirited reports; but I expect to see her pick up
wonderfully now you have come home. She didn't take enough outdoor
exercise, that's where the harm was. She used to be so fond of her boat
last year, but this year I fancy she didn't feel herself up to handling
the sculls. You didn't now, did you, Mrs. Disney?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, but I am ready to row to the Land's End, now
Martin is back," said Isola, and those few words seemed the sweetest
Martin Disney had heard since Colonel Manwaring's daughter promised to
be his wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham sat on the lawn, sipping her tea, and basking in the
afternoon sunshine.</p>

<p>"You should have seen your wife in her wedding-gown at the Lostwithiel
dance," she said. "You would have been proud of her. She didn't want
to go&mdash;refused Mrs. Crowther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and me again and again. She thought it
wasn't right to be at any merry-making while your life was in danger."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;I know. My tender-hearted Isola!"</p>

<p>"But at last we got the better of her objections; and though there were
a good many pretty women there, and though Miss Crowther, perhaps,
pleased most tastes, being a more showy style of beauty, to my thinking
there wasn't one came up to Mrs. Disney."</p>

<p>"Her partners seemed of the same opinion," put in the doctor, cheerily.
"Why, how often did Lord Lostwithiel dance with you, Mrs. Disney?
Oftener than with anybody else, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"I was very proud of my party that evening, I can tell you, Colonel
Disney," she said. "It isn't often that one has to chaperon three
attractive young women. Do you know that my youngest niece, Maria, has
had two offers since that night, Isola, and when I last heard from her
she was on the brink of an engagement? Ah, well, I hope we shall have
another ball next December, now that the neighbourhood has begun to
wake up a bit. We have been thinking of getting up a water picnic this
summer&mdash;just a little excursion to Mevagissey, and a little fishing for
those who might care for it."</p>

<p>"Very pleasant, indeed, of you," answered the colonel, cheerily. "We
will be there."</p>

<p>"The Crowthers are rather grand in their ideas," said the doctor, "but
Alicia is very keen upon all kind of sport, so I know she'll want to
come, whatever Belinda may say to it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham made a wry face at the name of the elder sister. It was
an involuntary and unconscious contortion; but Belinda had tried to
snub Mrs. Baynham, who never could forget that her father was a banker
at Truro, and held the fortunes&mdash;the mortgages and encumbrances of the
landed gentry&mdash;in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>"You don't like the elder Miss Crowther?" speculated the colonel.</p>

<p>"Well, if I am to be candid, I must confess that I have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> positive
aversion to that young lady. The airs she gives herself on the
strength of her father's wool are really insupportable, and since Lord
Lostwithiel disappointed her she has been more odious than she was
before."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by Lostwithiel disappointing her? Did he jilt her?"</p>

<p>"Well, it could scarcely be called jilting, and I really don't know
that there was anything between them; but people had coupled their
names&mdash;and he dined at Glenaveril at least once a week all the time he
was at the Mount&mdash;and people had quite made up their minds it was to
be a match. Mr. Crowther went about talking of Lord Lostwithiel and
his affairs as if he was his father-in-law&mdash;the neglected condition of
the land, and what ought to be done at the Mount, and that the estate
wanted judicious nursing, and all that sort of thing. And then one
December morning his lordship sailed off in his yacht before it was
light, and there was no more heard of him. It was quite in his way to
go off suddenly like that, but the Crowthers were evidently taken by
surprise, and we heard no more about Lord Lostwithiel and the Mount."</p>

<p>"They dropped him like a hot potato," said the doctor. "Well, we shall
depend upon you both for our water-party. It will not be till the
middle of July, when an old chum of mine, a sailor, will be coming this
way."</p>

<p>This was a sample of many such visits. In the country, and even in
London upon occasion, people are given to discussing the same subjects.
Martin Disney heard a good deal about the Crowthers and their supposed
disappointment. People liked Mrs. Crowther for her simple, unaffected
ways, and thorough-going kindliness; but Vansittart and his daughters
had made a good many enemies. He was too coarse; they were too fine;
only the mother's simple nature had caught the golden mean between
blunt vulgarity and artificial smartness.</p>

<p>Colonel Disney heard all this village gossip with an unheeding ear.
He was secure in his own position as a son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> the soil, a man whose
pedigree could pass muster with that of the Rashleighs and the
Treffrys, a man of means that were ample for his own unpretending
tastes and requirements. He cared not a jot how many guineas a year the
Crowthers might give to their cook, or how much Mr. Crowther had paid
for the furnishing and decoration of his house, a theme upon which the
gossips of the neighbourhood loved to enlarge. That Mrs. Crowther had
gowns from Worth, and that her daughters employed Mrs. Mason, irked
not this simple soldier. The only point in all the stream of talk that
had affected him was the unanimous opinion that Trelasco in the spring
had been too relaxing for Mrs. Disney, or else that her solitude had
preyed upon her mind, inasmuch as she had looked so ill as to afford an
interesting subject of conversation to a good many friendly people who
suffered from the chronic malady of not having enough to talk about, a
form of starvation almost as bad as not having enough to eat.</p>

<p>Tho colonel listened, and made his own conclusions. He did not believe
that Trelasco was "relaxing." Ho loved the district too well to believe
any evil thing about it. Those fresh breezes that blew up from the sea,
those balmy airs that breathed across the heather-clad hills, must
bring health with them. What could one have better than that mingling
of sea and hill, brine and honey, gorse-bloom and seaweed? No, Trelasco
was not to blame. His young wife had suffered for lack of youthful
company. He made up his mind accordingly.</p>

<p>"I suppose you won't object to our having Allegra here for a summer
visit, will you, love?" he asked at breakfast the day after Mrs.
Baynham's call. "London must be hot, and dusty, and dreary in July, and
she must want rest and country air, I fancy, after having worked so
hard in her art school."</p>

<p>Isola gave a scarcely perceptible sigh as she bent to caress Tim, a
privileged attendant of the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>"Object! Of course not, Martin. I shall be very pleased for your sister
to come here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel very sure you will be pleased with her when you and she get
upon intimate terms. You could know so little of her from that one
evening in the Cavendish Road."</p>

<p>The occasion in question was an evening in which Isola and her husband
had been bidden to a friendly dinner, on their way through London, by
the clergyman's widow with whom Allegra lived while she pursued her
study of art at a famous school in St. John's Wood. The clergyman's
widow, Mrs. Meynell, was a distant cousin of the Disneys, and Allegra's
home had been with her from the time she left school. The extent of her
wanderings after she was old enough to be sent to a boarding-school had
been from Falmouth to Kensington, and from Kensington to St. John's
Wood, with occasional holidays in the Isle of Thanet.</p>

<p>"I thought she was very fresh and bright and loving," answered Isola,
"and I could see even in that one evening that she was very fond of
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, God bless her, there is no doubt about that. I have been brother
and father too for her. She has had no one but me since our mother's
death."</p>

<p>"Shall I write and ask her to come to us, Martin, or will you?"</p>

<p>"I fancy she would take it more as a compliment if the invitation went
straight from you. She would know that I would be glad to have her, but
she might feel a little doubtful about you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll write to her to-day, Martin, and beg her to come at once&mdash;as
soon as ever she can pack her boxes."</p>

<p>"That's my darling! I hope she won't bore you when she is here. I have
a shrewd idea she'll make your life happier. She'll awaken you from
that languor which has grown upon you in your loneliness."</p>

<p>"At least I'll try to make her happy, Martin, if it is only for your
sake."</p>

<p>"Ah, and you will soon love her for her own sake."</p>

<p>"I'll get the boat looked to at once, and I'll see about making the
spare room pretty for her," said Isola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later Allegra was with them, breakfasting on the lawn in the
balmy atmosphere of July. There were two girls, in white gowns, under
the tulip tree, instead of one; and Martin Disney felt as if his
domestic happiness were doubled, as he looked at those two graceful
figures in the flickering light below that canopy of broad bright
leaves. Another element of comfort, too, had entered the Angler's Nest;
for the incompetent cook had taken her incompetency and a month's
wages to her native city of Truro; and a buxom damsel from Falmouth,
recommended by Tabitha, had already proved herself a treasure in the
culinary art.</p>

<p>Never was there a fairer picture than that domestic group under the
tulip tree. Tho two girlish figures in white muslin, with palest
salmon and palest azure ribbons fluttering and glancing in the light
and deepening in the shadow; the white fox-terrier, alert, muscular,
mercurial; the tortoise-shell cat, long-haired, aristocratic, and
demure; the pretty Moorish plateau on bamboo legs, the purple and
crimson breakfast service and rare old silver urn, the fruit and
flowers, and amber-hued butter, and rustic luxury of preserved fruit
and clotted cream.</p>

<p>"How lovely it all is after Cavendish Road!" cried Allegra,
rapturously. "When I see the lights and shadows upon those hills, I
despair of ever being able to paint a landscape as long as I live.
Nature is maddeningly beautiful."</p>

<p>"What is your particular line, Allegra?" asked her brother. "Is it
landscape?"</p>

<p>"No; I only care for landscape as a background for humanity. I want to
paint genre pictures in water-colour&mdash;women and children&mdash;beautiful
women amidst beautiful surroundings&mdash;picturesque poverty&mdash;interesting
bits of daily life. Mrs. Allingham is the ideal after which I strive,
but I am only at the bottom of the ladder. It is a long climb to
the top; but one does not mind that in a profession where labour is
delight."</p>

<p>"You are fond of art, then?" said Isola, watching the earnest face of
the speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fond of it! Why, I live for it! The dream of my life from the time I
was seven years old has been one long dream of the bliss that was to be
mine when I could feel myself able to paint. I have toiled with all my
might. Martin disliked the idea of my being an Academy student&mdash;poor,
foolish, ignorant Martin&mdash;so I have been obliged to plod on at St.
John's Wood, without hope of prizes or medals; but on the whole I have
been very lucky, for I have made friends among the Academicians. They
are very kind to any student who seems in rightdown earnest; and they
have been ever so good to me. I hope, Martin, you will find some day
that I am something better than an amateur," she concluded, resting her
two hands caressingly upon her brother's shoulder.</p>

<p>"My dearest, I have not the least doubt you will astonish me. I am very
ignorant of everything connected with art. I set my face against the
Academy because I thought the training and the life would be too public
for my sister."</p>

<p>"As if Burlington House were any more public than that big school at
St. John's Wood, my dear illogical brother: and yet we women are the
only people who are said to be wanting in the logical faculty."</p>

<p>She leant back in her basket-chair, revelling in the rural atmosphere,
and in that new sense of being in the bosom of her family. Tim leapt
upon her lap and licked her face, in token of his acceptance of her
into the home-circle. Nobody had ever called Miss Leland a beauty, nor
had she ever received those disquieting attentions which follow the
footsteps of exceptional loveliness. She was sometimes described as a
girl who grew upon one; and people who knew her well generally ended
by thinking her distractingly pretty. She had a brilliant complexion,
of the true English type, fair and blooming&mdash;a complexion which
indicated perfect health and an active, orderly life; no late hours or
novel-reading over the fire&mdash;an out-of-door complexion, which would
have looked its best under a neat little felt hat in the hunting-field,
or under a coquettish straw sailor hat on board a yacht. Her eyes were
blue-grey, with long, brown lashes and boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> marked eyebrows; her
nose was firmly modelled, inclining a little to the aquiline order. Her
mouth was the prettiest feature in her face, and yet it was a shade
larger than accepted perfection in mouths. It was a mouth chiefly
remarkable for character and expression; and, indeed, it was the
individuality and variety of expression in the fair young face which
constituted Miss Leland's chief claim to distinction.</p>

<p>She started up from the nest of basket-work and flowered chintz, and
stood tall and erect, a Juno-like young woman, with heavy plaits
of reddish-brown hair rolled in a great knot at the back of her
head. She might have answered one of those harsh advertisements for
parlour-maids, in which the words, "No fringe," figure with curt
cruelty; for her hair was brushed smoothly back from the fair forehead,
and the severity of the style became that wide sagacious brow. It was
just the kind of forehead which can endure exposure without conveying
an idea of bald ugliness.</p>

<p>She was tall and strongly made, fashioned after the semblance of Diana
or Atalanta rather than Venus or Psyche. Her every movement had the
bold, free grace of vigorous, unspoiled youth. She had always been
active&mdash;fond of walking, riding, rowing, swimming, as well as of art,
and with an ardent passion for the country, which had made existence in
a London suburb one long sacrifice.</p>

<p>"I used to take the train for Hampstead Heath or Willesden," she told
her brother, "and go off for long, lonely tramps to Finchley or Hendon.
I have watched the builder's progress along roads and lanes I loved.
I have seen horrid brick boxes creeping along like some new kind of
noxious insect, eating up fields and hedgerows, old hawthorns and old
hollies. I could have sat down in the muddy road and cried sometimes,
at the thought that soon there would be no country walk left within
reach of a Londoner. Once I went off to the north-east, to look for the
rural lanes Charles Lamb and his sister loved&mdash;the lanes and meadows
where they carried their little picnic basket, till they took shelter
at a homely inn. Oh, Martin, all those fields and lanes, Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Lamb's country&mdash;are going, going, or gone! It is heartbreaking! And
they are building at Fowey, too, I see. Positively there will be no
country anywhere soon. There will be crescents and terraces and little
ugly streets at the very Land's End, and the Logan Rock will be the
sign of a public-house."</p>

<p>"Don't be down-hearted, Chatterbox! I think Cornwall may last our
time," said Disney, laughing at her vehemence.</p>

<p>Allegra was a great talker. It seemed as if she had a well-spring of
joy and life within her which must find an outlet. When people ventured
to hint at her loquacity she declared that her name was in fault.</p>

<p>"I have grown up to match my name," she said; "if I had been christened
Penserosa I might have been quite a different person."</p>

<p>Her vivacity gave a new element of brightness to the Angler's Rest,
where Disney had been somewhat oppressed by the sensation of intense
repose which had pervaded his <i>tête-à-tête</i> life with Isola. He loved
his wife so entirely, so unselfishly, and devotedly, that it was
happiness to him to be with her; yet in the three or four weeks that
had gone by since his return he had struggled in vain against the
feeling that there was something wanting in his home. Isola waited
upon him and deferred to him with more than wifely submissiveness. He
would have liked a spurt of rebellion once in a way, a little burst of
girlish temper, just to show that she was human; but none ever came.
His every desire was anticipated. Whatever plan he suggested&mdash;to walk,
to drive, to visit, or not to visit&mdash;the river or the sea&mdash;was always
the plan that pleased her best, or at least she said so.</p>

<p>"I think I shall call you Griselda instead of Isola," he said one
day, taking the fair pale face between his hands and gazing into the
mournful depths of the dark violet eyes&mdash;inscrutable eyes they seemed
to him, when the pupils dilated under his gaze, as if the eyes made a
darkness to hide their meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>A flood of crimson passed over her face like a fire, and left her paler
than before.</p>

<p>"Because you are only too dutiful. Would you resist if I were to turn
tyrant, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I have no fear of your turning tyrant," she answered, with a sad
little smile; "you are only too good to me."</p>

<p>"Good! There can be no question of goodness. If a man picked up a
diamond as precious as the Koh-i-noor, could he be good to it? How can
I be good to my gem? I have but one thing left in the world to desire,
or to pray for."</p>

<p>"What is that, Martin?"</p>

<p>"To see you happy."</p>

<p>Again the sudden flame crimsoned her face, that sensitive spiritual
face which reflected every change of feeling.</p>

<p>"I am happy, Martin, quite happy, happier than I ever thought to be,
now that you are home again. What have I more to desire?"</p>

<p>"Is that really so? Was my long absence your greatest trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered slowly, looking at him with a curiously steady
look, "that was the beginning and end of my trouble."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he said, drawing a deep breath. "There have been
moments&mdash;just of late&mdash;when I have puzzled my brains about you&mdash;until I
thought&mdash;" very slowly, "there might have been something else."</p>

<p>He clasped her in his arms, and hid her face upon his breast, as
if&mdash;fearing that he might have wounded her by those last words&mdash;he
wanted to make amends before she had time to feel his unkindness. His
tenderness for her had so much of that pitying love which a strong man
feels for a child.</p>

<p>This conversation occurred the day before Allegra's arrival; but with
that young lady's appearance on the scene, new life and gladness came
into the little household. Allegra sang, Allegra played, Allegra ran
out into the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> twenty times a day, and called through the open
window to Isola, sitting quietly in the drawing-room, to come out and
look at this or that&mdash;a rose finer than all other roses&mdash;a suggested
alteration&mdash;an atmospheric effect&mdash;anything and everything. She was a
keen observer of Nature, full of vivid interest in every creature that
lived, and in every flower that grew. Tim followed her everywhere as
she danced along the gravel walks, or across the short springy turf.
Tim adored her, and grinned at her, and threw himself into all manner
of wriggling attitudes upon the grass to express his delight in her
company, and fawned at her feet, and talked to her after his guttural
fashion, snorting his friendly feelings. Tim had long languished for
such a companion, having found his young mistress's society very
heavy of late. No more runs in the meadow, no more rambles in the
neighbouring spinney, and very little boating. But now that Allegra had
come the skiff was seldom idle. Isola had to go on the river whether
she liked or not. There were strong young arms ready to pull her&mdash;round
young arms, of a lovely roseate fairness, which looked their best,
stretched to the motion of the sculls, with the white cambric shirt
rolled up above the elbow.</p>

<p>"You can read Shelley while I scull the boat," said Allegra. "I don't
want any help. If you knew what rapture it is to me to feel the breath
of Seagods and Tritons after St. John's Wood, and the smoke from the
Metropolitan Railway, you wouldn't pity me."</p>

<p>Isola submitted, and sat at her ease upon bright-coloured cushions with
an Indian rug spread round her, as idle as if she had been the belle of
a Zenana, and read Alastor while the boat sped seaward in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Sometimes they moored their boat at the landing stage at Polruan, and
walked up the hill to the Point, and sat there for an hour or two
in the summer wind with their books and picnic basket, seeing great
ships go out towards the Lizard and the big distant world, or sail
merrily homeward towards Plymouth and the Start. Isola looked at those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
outward-bound ships with a strange longing in her eyes&mdash;a longing to
flee away upon those broad wings that flashed whitely in the sunlit
distance. Were people happy on board those ships, she wondered, happy
at escaping from the fetters of an old life and a beaten path, happy
going away to strange lands and freedom? She had been reading many
books of travel of late, and a kind of passion for remote uncivilized
countries had come upon her; as if that untrammelled life meant release
from memory and saddening cares&mdash;a new birth almost. It seemed from
some of those books as if there could be no greater happiness upon this
earth than to tramp across sandy deserts and stalk occasional lions;
while in others the supreme good seemed to be found in the attempt to
scale impossible mountains. What was it that made the rapture of these
things? Isola wondered. Was it that perils and wild solitudes offered
the only possible escape out of a past existence, on this side the
grave? Allegra had never so much as crossed the Channel. She had been
brought up in the most humdrum fashion. First a school at Falmouth,
and then a smarter school at Kensington, and then St. John's Wood and
the Art School. Her mother had died when she was fourteen years of
age, and since that time her brother had been her only guardian and
almost her only friend. Her life had seen but little variety, and very
little of the dancing and gaiety which for most girls is the only form
of pleasure. She and Isola talked about the ships as they sat upon the
grassy hill at Polruan, and speculated about the lands of which they
knew only what they had read in books of travel.</p>

<p>"You, at least, know what France is like," said Allegra, "and that is
something."</p>

<p>"Only one little corner of France."</p>

<p>"And to think that you were born in an old French city! It seems
strange. Do you feel at all French?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so; only sometimes a longing comes upon me to see
the old grey walls, and to hear the old voices, and see the curious
old women in their white caps and bright-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>coloured handkerchiefs,
clattering along to the Cathedral. There must be more old women in
Brittany than in Cornwall, I think. Fowey does not swarm with old
women as Dinan did. And sometimes I long to see mother, and the good
old Brittany servants, and the garden where the hours went by so
slowly&mdash;almost as slowly as they go here"&mdash;with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Does time go so very slowly here?" asked Allegra, quickly. "That
sounds as if you were unhappy."</p>

<p>"What nonsense you talk!" cried Isola, with a flash of sudden anger.
"Cannot one be dull and bored sometimes&mdash;from very idleness&mdash;without
being unhappy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but, for my own part, when I am happy I am never dull."</p>

<p>"You have more of what people call animal spirits than I have."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you apologize in a manner for that odious phrase&mdash;animal
spirits. I would not apply such a phrase to Tim. It suggests nothing
but Audrey at a statute fair. Heaven gave me a capacity for happiness,
and I thank God every night in my prayers for another happy day. Even
at school I contrived to be happy, somehow; and think what it must be
after seven years of dull routine to feel that I have done with sitting
at a stranger's table and that I am here in a home, my own home, with
my brother and sister."</p>

<p>Tho two women clasped hands, and kissed each other upon this. Only the
night before Isola, of her own free will, had asked her sister-in-law
to make her home at the Angler's Nest always, always, till she should
be led out of it as a bride; and Martin had shown himself supremely
happy in the knowledge that his sister had won his wife's love and
confidence.</p>

<p>When Isola and he were alone together after the sealing of that family
bond, he kissed and thanked her for this boon which she had bestowed
upon him.</p>

<p>"I never could have felt quite at ease while Allegra was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> living with
strangers," he told her. "And now my cup is full. But are you sure,
dearest, that you will never find her in the way, never fancy yourself
any the less mistress of your house, and of my life, because she is
here?"</p>

<p>"Never, never, never! I am gladder than I can say to have her. She is a
delightful companion. She helps me in a hundred ways. But even if she
were less charming it would be my duty to have her here since you like
her to be with us."</p>

<p>"But it must not be done as a duty. I will not have you sacrifice your
inclination in the slightest degree."</p>

<p>"What an obtuse person you are! Don't I tell you that I am enchanted to
have her? She is as much my sister as ever Gwendolen was; indeed, she
is much more sympathetic than Gwen ever was."</p>

<p>"Then I am perfectly content."</p>

<p>Allegra wrote to Mrs. Meynell next day, announcing the decision
that had been arrived at, not without grateful acknowledgments of
that lady's kindness. The rest of her belongings were to be sent to
her forthwith, easels, and colour-boxes, books and knickknacks; her
brother's gifts, most of them from the romantic East; things which
made her few little Kensingtonian keepsakes look very trivial and
Philistine. Allegra's possessions gave a new individuality to the
large, airy bedroom, and the tiny boudoir at the corner of the house,
looking seaward, which Isola had arranged for her.</p>

<p>While these things were doing Martin Disney was buying horses and
buying land&mdash;a farm of over two hundred acres which would make his
property better worth holding&mdash;and he had further employed a Plymouth
architect to plan an enlargement of the old-fashioned cottage&mdash;a new
and much more spacious drawing-room, two bedrooms over, a verandah
below, and a loggia above. In that mild climate the loggia would
afford a pleasant lounge even in winter, and myrtle and roses would
speedily cover the wooden columns which sustained the tiled roof. It
was to be a homely Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> loggia&mdash;unpretentious, and not particularly
architectural; but Isola and her sister-in-law were delighted at the
idea.</p>

<p>The stables were to be enlarged as well as the house.</p>

<p>"You have no idea how I have hoarded and scraped to lay by money ever
since I bought the Nest," said Disney. "I believe I was the greatest
screw in the service all through my last campaign."</p>

<p>He laughed aloud in amused remembrance of many small sacrifices, while
the three heads clustered over the architect's plan, which had that
factitious prettiness of delicate drawing and colour which makes every
house so much nearer perfection upon paper than it ever can be in brick
and stone.</p>

<p class="center">"LIES NOTHING BURIED LONG AGO?"</p>


<p>Like most small country settlements, little fraternities of well-to-do
people who think themselves the beginning and end of the world,
Trelasco was slow to rise to any festivity in the way of party-giving.
So it was about two months after Colonel Disney's return before
the friendly calls and interchange of small civilities culminated
in a dinner-party at Glenaveril. It seemed, indeed, only right and
natural that the great house of the district, great by reason of Lord
Lostwithiel's non-residence, should be the first to open its doors in a
ceremonial manner to the colonel and his womankind. The invitation to
his sister might be taken as an especial compliment, arms outstretched
to receive one who was a stranger in the land.</p>

<p>"We want to know that nice, young sister of yours," Mr. Crowther said
to Colonel Disney, in his patronizing way, as they all came out of
church the Sunday before the dinner-party. "A remarkably fine girl."</p>

<p>The colonel did not thank him for this compliment, which was pronounced
in a loud voice, amidst the little knot of acquaintances taking leave
of each other on the dip of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> hill, where there was a sign-post on a
patch of waste grass, and where road and lanes divided, one up the hill
to Tywardreath, another to Fowey, and a narrow-wooded lane leading down
to Glenaveril and the Angler's Nest. Short as the distance was, there
were carriages waiting for the Crowthers, who never walked to church,
however fine the weather. Mrs. Crowther came to the morning service
resplendent in a brocade gown and a Parisian bonnet, on pain of being
condemned as dowdy by her husband, who liked to put the stamp of his
wealth upon every detail. His wife obeyed him with wifely meekness, but
the daughters were not so easily ruled. Both were keen-witted enough to
feel the vulgarity of Sunday morning splendour. So Belinda worshipped
in the exaggerated simplicity of an unstarched jaconet muslin, a yellow
Liberty sash, a flopping Gainsborough hat, and a necklace of Indian
beads, an attire which attracted every eye, and was a source of wonder
to the whole congregation, while Alicia's neat grey cashmere frock,
and smart little toque to match, grey gloves, grey Prayer-book and
sunshade, challenged criticism as a study in monochrome.</p>

<p>Mr. Crowther would have lingered for farther conversation before
getting into the family landau, but Colonel Disney bade a rather abrupt
good morning to the whole group, and hurried his wife and sister down
the hill.</p>

<p>"I'm rather sorry we accepted the Glenaveril invitation," he said to
Isola. "The man is such an unmitigated cad."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Crowther is very kind and good," replied his wife; "but I have
never cared much about going to Glenaveril. I don't feel that I get on
particularly well with the girls. They are both too fine for me. But I
should be sorry to offend Mrs. Crowther."</p>

<p>"Yes, she seems a kindly creature. It was thoughtful of her sending you
a ticket for the ball. A woman with daughters is seldom over-kind to
outsiders."</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe Mrs. Crowther's heart is big enough to be kind to a
whole parish."</p>

<p>"Well, on her account, perhaps it was best to accept the invitation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be so grand about it, Martin," said Allegra. "You forget that
I am pining to see what a dinner-party in a very rich house is like.
I have seen nothing in London but literary and artistic dinners,
third-rate literary and third-rate artistic, I'm afraid&mdash;but they were
very nice, all the same. Glenaveril is a place that takes my breath
away; and I am curious to see what a dinner-party can be like there."</p>

<p>"Then for your sake, Allegra, I'm glad we said yes. Only I couldn't
stand that fellow patronizing you. Calling you a fine girl, forsooth!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is an odious phrase, is it not? I'm afraid I shall have to
live through it, because, like Rosalind, 'I am more than common tall.'"</p>

<p>She drew herself up to her full height, straight as a reed, but with
fully developed bust and shoulders which showed to advantage in her
pale tussore gown&mdash;silk that her brother had sent her from India. She
looked the incarnation of girlish innocence and girlish happiness&mdash;a
brow without a cloud, a step light as a fawn's&mdash;a fearless, joyous
nature. Her more commonplace features and finer figure were in
curious contrast with Isola's pensive beauty and too fragile form.
Disney glanced from one to the other as he walked along the rustic
lane between them; and, though he thought his wife the lovelier, he
regretted that she was not more like his sister.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man who is very fond of home and who has no professional cares and
occupations is apt to degenerate into a molly-coddle. Martin Disney
gave an indication of this weakness on the day before the dinner at
Glenaveril.</p>

<p>"What are you two girls going to wear?" he asked. "At least, I don't
think I need ask Isola that question. You'll wear your wedding-gown, of
course, love?" he added, turning to his wife.</p>

<p>"No, Martin, I am going to wear my grey silk."</p>

<p>"Grey! A dowager's colour, a soured spinster's colour&mdash;a Quaker's no
colour. I detest grey."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but this is a very pretty gown&mdash;the palest shade of pearl
colour&mdash;and I wear pink roses with it. It was made in Paris. I feel
sure you will like me in it, Martin," Isola said hurriedly, as if even
this small matter fluttered her nerves.</p>

<p>"Not as well as I like you in your wedding-gown. That was made in
Paris, and it fitted you like a glove. I never saw such a pretty
gown&mdash;so simple, yet so elegant."</p>

<p>"I have been married much too long to dress as a bride."</p>

<p>"You shall not seem as a bride&mdash;except to me. For my eyes only shall
you shine in bridal loveliness. Bride or no bride, what can be prettier
for a young woman than a white satin gown with a long train? You can
wear some touch of colour to show you have not got yourself up as a
bride. What do you say, Allegra? Give us your opinion. Of course you
are an authority upon dress."</p>

<p>"Oh, the white satin, by all means. Isola looks ethereal in white. She
ought hardly ever to wear anything else."</p>

<p>"You hear, Isa. Two to one against you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't be governed by your opinions in this instance. You
forget that I last wore my gown at a ball. I danced a good deal&mdash;the
floor was dirty&mdash;the gown was spoilt. I shall never wear it again. I
hope that will satisfy you, Martin."</p>

<p>She spoke with a touch of temper, her cheeks flushed crimson, and
her eyes filled with sudden tears as she looked deprecatingly at her
husband. Martin Disney felt himself a brute.</p>

<p>"My dearest, I didn't mean to tease you," he said; "wear anything you
like. You are sure to be the prettiest woman in the room. I am sorry
the gown was spoilt; but it can't be helped. I'll buy you another white
satin gown the first time you and I are in Plymouth together. And,
pray, Miss Allegra, what bravery will you sport?"</p>

<p>"I have only a white lace frock that has seen some service," replied
his sister, meekly. "I dare say I shall look like somebody's poor
relation at such a place as Glenaveril."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's not to be a grand party, by any means. Mrs. Crowther told me
she had asked the Baynhams and the Vicarage people to meet us, just in
a friendly way."</p>

<p>The party was decidedly small, for on arriving with reasonable
punctuality the Disneys found only one guest on the scene, in the
person of Mr. Colfox, the curate, who was sitting by one of the little
tables, showing a new puzzle of two pieces of interlinked iron to the
two Misses Crowther. These young ladies were so interested in the trick
of disentanglement that they scarcely noticed the entrance of their
mother's guests, and only rose and came over to greet the party three
minutes later, as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Crowther, however, were both upon the alert to receive
their friends, the lady frankly cordial, the gentleman swelling with
pompous friendliness, as if his manly breast were trying to emerge from
the moderate restriction of a very open waistcoat. He protested that
he was charmed to welcome Colonel Disney to Glenaveril, and he glanced
round the splendid walls as who should say, "It is no light thing to
invite people to such a house as this."</p>

<p>Vansittart Crowther was a man of short, squat figure, who tried to make
up for the want of inches by extreme uprightness, and had cultivated
this carriage until he seemed incapable of bending. He had a bald
head, disguised by one dappled streak of grey and sandy hair, which
was plastered into a curl on each side of his brow&mdash;curls faintly
suggestive of a cat's ears. He had blunt features, a sensual lip, and
dull, fishy eyes, large and protuberant, with an expression in perfect
harmony with the heavy, sensual mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Baynham were the next arrivals; the lady wearing the
family amethysts and the well-known black velvet, under whose weighty
splendour she arrived short of breath; the gentleman expansive of shirt
front, and genial of aspect, jovial at the prospect of a good dinner
and choice wines, and not hypercritical as to the company in which he
ate the feast. He shook hands with his host and hostess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> and then
went over to the Misses Crowther, who had not thought it necessary to
suspend their absorbing occupation in order to welcome the village
doctor's wife&mdash;a fact which Mrs. Baynham observed and inwardly resented.</p>

<p>Mr. Colfox deserted the young ladies, still puzzling over the two
bits of iron, and went across the room to greet the Disneys. He was
an intelligent young man, steeped to the lips in the opinions and the
prejudices of university life&mdash;Oxford life, that is to say. He ranked
as a literary man in Trelasco, on the strength of having had an article
almost published in Blackwood. "The editor had accepted my paper," he
told people modestly; "but on further consideration he found it was a
little too long, and so, in point of fact, he sent it back to me in the
most courteous manner. He couldn't have acted more kindly&mdash;but I was
disappointed. It would have been such an opening, you see."</p>

<p>All Mr. Colfox's friends agreed that with such an opening the high road
to literary fame and fortune would have been made smooth for his feet.
They respected him even for this disappointment. To have been accepted
by Blackwood made him almost a colleague of George Eliot.</p>

<p>He was a tall and rather lean young man, who wore an eye-glass, and
seemed to live upon books. It was irritating to Vansittart Crowther,
who prided himself on his cellar and his cook, to note how little
impression food and drink made upon Francis Colfox.</p>

<p>"He takes my Château Yquem as if it were Devonshire cider," said the
aggrieved parvenu, "and he hardly seems to know that this is the only
house where he ever sees clear turtle. The man's people must have lived
in a very poor way."</p>

<p>In spite of this contemptuous opinion, Mr. Crowther was always polite
to Francis Colfox, and had even thought of him as a <i>pis-aller</i> for
one of his daughters. There is hardly anything in this life which a
self-made man respects so much as race, and Francis Colfox belonged to
an old county family, had a cousin who was an earl, and another cousin
who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> talked of as a probable bishop. He was, therefore, allowed to
make himself very much at home at Glenaveril, and to speak his mind in
a somewhat audacious way to the whole family.</p>

<p>Captain Pentreath, an army man of uncertain age, a bachelor, and one
of a territorial family of many brothers, came next; and then appeared
the vicar and his wife and one daughter, who made up the party. The
vicar was deaf, but amiable, and beamed benevolently upon a world about
whose spoken opinions he knew so little that he might naturally have
taken it for a much better world than it is. The vicar's wife spent her
existence in interpreting and explaining people's speech to the vicar,
and had no time to spare for opinions of her own. The daughter was
characterized by a gentle nullity, tempered by a somewhat enthusiastic
and evangelical piety. The chief desire of her life was to keep the
Church as it had been in the days of her childhood, nearly thirty years
before.</p>

<p>It was the first time the Disneys had dined together at Glenaveril, so
it seemed only proper that Mr. Crowther should give his arm to Isola,
which he did with an air of conferring an honour. The colonel had been
ordered to take the vicar's wife, and the doctor was given to Allegra;
Captain Pentreath took Miss Trequite, the vicar's daughter; Mr. Colfox
followed with Mrs. Baynham, and the daughters of the house went
modestly to the dining-room after the vicar and Mrs. Crowther.</p>

<p>The dinner-table was as pretty as roses and Venetian glass could
make it. There was no pompous display of ponderous plate, as there
might have been thirty years ago on a parvenu's board. Everybody
is enlightened nowadays. The great "culture" movement has been as
widespread among the middle class as compulsory education among the
proletariat, and everybody has "a taste." Scarcely were they seated,
when Mr. Crowther informed Mrs. Disney that he hated a display of
silver, but at the same time took care to let her know that the
Venetian glass she admired was rather more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> valuable than that precious
metal. "And if it's broken, there's nothing left you for your outlay,"
he said; "but it's a fancy of my wife and girls. Those decanters are
better than anything Salviati ever made for Royalty."</p>

<p>The table was oval, lighted by one large lamp, under an umbrella-shaped
amber shade, a lamp which diffused a faint golden glow through the
dusky room; and through this dreamy dimness the footmen moved like
ghosts, while the table and the faces of the diners shone and sparkled
in the brilliant light. It was as picturesque a dining-room and table
as one need care to see; and if the Gainsboroughs and Reynoldses, which
here and there relieved the sombre russet of the Cordovan leather
hangings, were not the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Crowther's ancestors,
they were not the less lovely or interesting as works of art.</p>

<p>Isola sat by her host's side, with a silent and somewhat embarrassed
air, which her husband noted as he watched her from the other side of
the table.</p>

<p>All the decorations were low, so that no pyramid of fruit or flowers
intervened to prevent a man watching the face opposite to him. Disney
saw that while Allegra, in her place between Mr. Baynham and Alicia
Crowther, was full of talk and animation, Isola sat with downcast eyes,
and replied with a troubled look to her host's remarks. There was
something in that gentleman's manner which was particularly obnoxious
to the colonel&mdash;a protecting air, a fatherly familiarity, which brought
the bald, shining forehead almost in contact with Isola's shoulder, as
the man bent to whisper and to titter in the very ear of his neighbour.</p>

<p>The colonel got through a little duty talk with Mrs. Trequite, whose
attention was frequently distracted by the necessity of explaining
Mrs. Crowther's polite murmurs to the vicar on the other side of the
table; and this duty done he gave himself up to watching Isola and her
host. Why did she blush so when the man talked to her? Was it the bold
admiration of those fishy eyes which annoyed her, or the man's manner
altogether; or was it anything that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> said? Disney strained his ears
to hear their conversation, if that could be called conversation which
was for the most part monologue.</p>

<p>The man was talking of the Hunt Ball of last winter. Disney heard such
snatches of speech as "the prettiest woman in the room," "everybody
said so," "Lostwithiel was evidently <i>épris</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Crowther had a penchant for scraps of French, which decorated his
speech as truffles adorn a boned turkey.</p>

<p>"Isn't it odd that he should be such a rover?" he asked, in a less
confidential tone than before.</p>

<p>Isola looked up at him, as if hardly understanding the question.</p>

<p>"I mean Lostwithiel. With such a nice place as he has here, it seems a
pity to be broiling himself in Peru. I never could understand the taste
for orchids; and in his case&mdash;well, I hardly believe in it. He is the
last man to emulate a Hooker or a Lawrence. Orchid-hunting must be an
excuse for keeping away from England, I take it. Don't you think so,
now, Mrs. Disney?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know why he should want to keep away? No, no more does
anybody else. Only we all wonder, don't you know. He talked to me of
settling down in the county&mdash;looking after the estate a little. He
even hinted that he might, in due course, cast about for a nice young
wife&mdash;with a little money. And then all of a sudden off he sails in
that rakish yacht of his, and roves from port to port like the Flying
Dutchman in the Opera, till at last we hear of him on the coast of
Peru. Curious, ain't it, Mrs. Disney?"</p>

<p>"Why curious?" asked Isola, coldly. "Was not Lord Lostwithiel always
fond of yachting?"</p>

<p>"No doubt; but when a man talks of settling down in his native
place&mdash;and then doesn't do it&mdash;there must be a reason, mustn't there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. People act as often from caprice as from reason."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, that is a lady's idea. No man who is worthy the name ever acts
from caprice," said Mr. Crowther, with his insinuating air, as if some
hidden meaning were in the words, and then looking across the table and
seeing the colonel's watchful face, he altered both tone and manner as
he added, "Of course you know Lostwithiel, Colonel Disney?"</p>

<p>"I saw a good deal of Lord Lostwithiel when he was a small boy,"
answered the colonel, coldly. "His father was one of my early friends.
But that is a long time ago."</p>

<p>"How old is he, do you say?"</p>

<p>"Debrett will answer that question better than I can. I have never
reckoned the years that have gone by since I saw him in an Eton collar."</p>

<p>The men did not sit long over their wine. The doctor and his host
talked agriculture, Mr. Crowther discussing all farming operations
upon a large scale as became a man of territorial magnitude. The vicar
prosed about an approaching lecture at the schoolroom, and utterly
failed in hearing anything that was said in reply to his observations.
Colonel Disney smoked a cigarette in silence, and with a moody brow.</p>

<p>Later, in the drawing-room, while the Crowther girls were playing a
clamorous duet, by the last fashionable Sclavonic composer, Vansittart
Crowther directed his conversation almost wholly to Mrs. Disney, as
if she were the only person worthy of his attention. He was full
of suggestions for future gaieties in which the Disneys were to
share&mdash;picnics, boating parties.</p>

<p>"You must help us to wake up the neighbourhood, colonel," he said,
addressing Disney, with easy friendliness.</p>

<p>"We are not very likely to be of much assistance to you in that line,"
Disney answered coldly. "We are quiet stay-at-home people, my wife and
I, and take our pleasures on a very small scale."</p>

<p>Colonel Disney's carriage was announced at this moment. He gave his
wife a look which plainly indicated his wish to depart, and she rose
quickly from the low, deep chair in which she had been sitting, in
some manner a captive, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> Mr. Crowther lolled across the broad,
plush-cushioned arm to talk to her. Allegra was engrossed in a talk
about William Morris's last poem with Mr. Colfox, who was delighted
to converse with any one fresh from the far-away world of art and
literature&mdash;delighted altogether with Allegra, whose whole being
presented a piquant contrast to the Miss Crowthers. But the colonel's
sister saw the movement towards departure, and hastened to her
brother's side. Briefest adieux followed, and the first of the guests
being gone, left behind them a feeling of uneasiness in those whose
carriages had been ordered half an hour later. One premature departure
will cast a blight upon your small dull party; whereas from a scene of
real mirth the nine Muses and three Graces might all slip away unmissed
and unobserved.</p>

<p class="center">"OF THE WEAK MY HEART IS WEAKEST."</p>


<p>"You had better send cards to Mrs. Crowther, Isola," said Martin
Disney, two days afterwards, when his wife was sitting at her Davenport
writing her family letters.</p>

<p>"Cards! Oh, Martin, she would think that so very formal. I can call
upon her. She is always at home on Thursday afternoons, and she likes
me to go."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that, since I had rather you should never enter her
house again."</p>

<p>"Martin!"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say against Mrs. Crowther, my dear Isola. But
the man is more detestable than I could have believed low birth and
unlimited money could make any man. Guileless and inexperienced as you
are, I think you must have felt that his manner to you the other night
was familiar to the point of being insulting."</p>

<p>Isola had felt both embarrassed and distressed by her host's
attentions&mdash;the insinuating inflections of his fat, pompous voice; his
air of being upon a confidential footing with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> It had seemed to
her on that evening as if for the first time in her life, before the
eyes of men and women, she drank the cup of shame. She had said no word
to her husband of Mr. Crowther's oppressive familiarity, and she had
fondly hoped that the matter had escaped his notice.</p>

<p>She sat before him now, flushed and agitated, with lowered eyelids, and
one hand restlessly moving about the papers on her blotting-pad.</p>

<p>"My dearest, there is nothing in all this to distress you," said
Disney, with infinite gentleness. "It is not your fault that the man is
a cad; but it would be my fault if I were to allow you or Allegra to go
to his house again."</p>

<p>"He was not rude to Allegra."</p>

<p>"No; it would be her turn next, perhaps. He did not mean to be rude to
you. He only wanted to be especially polite in his own odious fashion.
There are men in that class who cannot behave decently to a pretty
woman, or civilly to a plain one. He meant no doubt to gratify you by
his compliments. What a stress he laid upon Lostwithiel's attention to
you at the ball. Were his attentions so very marked?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; not more to me than to others," Isola answered quickly. "He
danced a good many times&mdash;twice or three times&mdash;with Belinda Crowther.
Everybody noticed them as the handsomest couple in the room; not that
he is handsome, of course&mdash;only tall and distinguished-looking."</p>

<p>Allegra came running in from the garden, and broke the thread of
the conversation. Isola put the visiting-cards into an envelope and
addressed it to Mrs. Vansittart Crowther. She felt that the kindly
matron would be puzzled and vexed at this ceremony, from a young person
towards whom she had assumed so motherly a tone, urging her to run over
to Glenaveril at any hour of the day&mdash;asking her to lunch or to tea at
least once a week&mdash;wanting to take her for drives to Lostwithiel, or
railway jaunts to Plymouth.</p>

<p>Isola was not mistaken, for Mrs. Crowther called three or four days
afterwards and upbraided her for sending the cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might have all come to tea on Thursday, if you had been
good-natured," she said. "Mr. Colfox read us a poem by Swinburne, out
of one of the new magazines&mdash;there are so many nowadays that I never
remember which is which. Belinda was delighted with it&mdash;but Alicia and
I can't rise to her height. Mr. Colfox reads poetry beautifully. You
can't judge of his powers by only hearing him read the lessons," added
Mrs. Crowther, as if the English Bible were a poor thing.</p>

<p>She stopped an hour, praised Isola's tea-making and the new cook's
tea-cakes, asked a great many questions about Allegra's ideas and
occupations, and was as hearty, and simple, and friendly, and natural
as if she had been a duchess.</p>

<p>It grieved Isola to be obliged to refuse an invitation to luncheon,
most cordially pressed upon her and Allegra.</p>

<p>"I would drive you both to Lostwithiel after lunch, and we could do our
little bit of shopping and then have a cup of tea at the Talbot while
the horses had their mouths washed out, and I'd show you the room where
your brother's wife was so much admired last year, Miss Leland, and
where I hope you'll have many a good dance next winter. Now the ice
is broken we mean to go on with our balls, I can tell you. Indeed, my
girls are thinking of trying to get up a tennis-club ball about the end
of September."</p>

<p>This was the last time Mrs. Vansittart Crowther appeared in a
friendly manner at the Angler's Nest, for after two or three further
invitations&mdash;to a picnic&mdash;to tea&mdash;to lunch&mdash;had been declined, in
most gracious little notes from Isola, that good lady perceived that
there was some kind of barrier to friendly intercourse between her and
Colonel Disney's wife, and she told herself with some touch of honest
middle-class dignity that if Martin Disney was proud she could be proud
too, and that she would make no further offer of friendship which was
undesired.</p>

<p>"I suppose he thinks because he comes of a good old family, while we
have made our money in trade, that we are not quite good enough to
associate with his wife and sister,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> she said to her daughters. "I
thought he was too much of a gentleman to have such a petty feeling."</p>

<p>"How innocent you are, mother," cried Alicia, contemptuously; "can't
you see that they are all bursting with envy? That was what made the
colonel so gloomy and disagreeable the night of our little dinner. He
was vexed to see things done with as good taste as in a nobleman's
house. It cuts these poor gentilities to the quick to see that.
They don't much mind our being rich, if we will only be vulgar and
uneducated. But when we have the impertinence to be as well up in the
ways of good society as they are themselves, they can't forgive us.
Good taste in a parvenu is the unforgivable sin."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," mused Mrs. Crowther, sadly. "I'm sure there's
neither pride nor envy in Isola, and Miss Leland looks a frank,
straightforward girl, above all foolish nonsense; so it must be the
colonel's fault that they've cut us."</p>

<p>"Cut us!" echoed Belinda; "the Angler's Nest cutting Glenaveril is
rather too absurd an idea."</p>

<p>"My dear, you don't know the importance Cornish people attach to old
family&mdash;and the Disneys are a very old family&mdash;and no one can deny that
he is a gentleman, though we don't like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, no doubt he considers that he belongs to the landed gentry. He has
bought Rowe's farm, two hundred and sixty acres. He had forty to begin
with, so he is now lord of three hundred acres, just half our home
farm."</p>

<p>"His cousin, Sir Luke Disney, has a large estate near Marazion," said
Mrs. Crowther, meekly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we don't reckon a man's importance by his cousin's estate.
Colonel Disney is only a squatter in this part of the country."</p>

<p>Alicia pronounced the word with gusto. It had been whispered
to her that the squire of Fowey had spoken of her father&mdash;who
counted his acres by thousands&mdash;as a squatter. That unimpeachable
importance, founded upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> the established respectability of bygone
centuries&mdash;centuries in which men wore armour and women breakfasted on
beef and ale&mdash;was not to be bought with gold and silver, and the want
of it often made the Miss Crowthers angry. Diamonds they could have,
and land, art, and beauty, even the ways and manners of good society,
but they could not buy themselves a history. Everybody knew that their
splendours had all come out of a cloth mill, that their ingots had been
in some part transmuted from pestiferous woollen rags gathered in the
Jewish quarters of far-off cities, ground into shoddy, and anon issued
to the world as sleek superfine cloth. The more shoddy the higher
interest upon capital; and Vansittart Crowther's daughters knew too
many of the secrets of the mills to be proud of the source of their
prosperity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crowther was sorry to lose Isola as a friend and <i>protégée</i>. Her
daughters were furious at the slight implied in this gradual dropping
away. They passed Mrs. Disney and her sister-in-law with their noses
in the air, as they went from the church-porch to their carriage. They
cut them ostentatiously if they met on the quiet country roads. Mrs.
Crowther would still stop to speak and shake hands, albeit she urged no
further invitations.</p>

<p>And while the gulf widened between the great house and the small one
the glorious Cornish summer waned, and slowly, slowly, melted away,
lingering very late in that fair western land, which was full of
flowers even when the home counties were being withered and blackened
by the first frosts. At last came winter, and the gradual turn of the
year; short days slowly lengthening out by leisurely sunsets; pale
snowdrops glimmering in the borders; and then the gold of crocuses and
the bright blue of the Siberian bell-flower in patches of vivid colour;
and then hyacinths and tulips, primroses on every bank, narcissus and
jonquil in every garden; and by-and-by the full glory of bluebell and
hawthorn blossom. And anon in the middle of May came an event in which
all the interests of Colonel Disney's life seemed to culminate. In that
balmy Maytime Isola's firstborn son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> came into the world, and Isola's
young life hovered at the gate of death, in so terrible an uncertainty
that Martin Disney's hair grew grey while he awaited the issue of the
contest between youth and weakness.</p>

<p>For more than a week after the birth of her baby Isola's condition had
satisfied the trained nurse and the kindly doctor. She was very white
and weak, and she showed less interest in her baby than most young
mothers&mdash;a fact which Mr. Baynham ascribed to over-education.</p>

<p>"The young women of the present day aren't half such good mothers as
those I used to attend when I began practice," he said discontentedly.
"Their heads are stuffed with poetry, and such-like. They're nervous
and fanciful&mdash;and the upshot of it all is that babies have to be
wet-nursed or brought up by hand. If I had the government of a model
state I wouldn't allow any married woman the run of a library until she
had reared the last of her babies. What does a young married woman want
with book-learning? She ought to have enough to do to look after her
husband and her nursery."</p>

<p>Before the baby son was a fortnight old, fever supervened, and Isola's
state gave poor Mr. Baynham the keenest anxiety. A hospital nurse was
sent for to assist the established custodian; and a great authority was
brought over from Plymouth to approve the village doctor's treatment,
and to make a trifling alteration in a prescription, substituting
bromide of sodium for bromide of potassium.</p>

<p>Many days and nights of delirium followed the physician's visit, a
period in which the patient was watched at every hour of the day and
night; and one of the most constant watchers through all that dreary
time was Martin Disney. It was in vain that Allegra and the nurses
urged him to consider his own health. He would consent only to leave
the sick-room for briefest intervals of rest. Day after day, night
after night, he sat in the same chair&mdash;an old-fashioned armchair, with
projecting sides, which almost hid him from the patient&mdash;beside the
bed. He was never in the way of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> nurse. He was always helpful when
a man's help was needed. He was so quiet that it was impossible to
object to his presence. He sat there like a statue of patience. No moan
escaped his pallid lips; no tear stole down his haggard cheek. He sat
and watched and waited for the issue, which was to make him happy, or
desolate for ever.</p>

<p>All his future was involved in that issue. He looked with a faint
smile upon the pink little baby face, when they brought his son to
him. No one would have dared to suggest that he should take care of
himself and be comforted for that little one's sake. They all knew
that his firstborn was as nothing to him. All his hopes and all his
fears were centred in the wife who lay upon yonder bed, with glassy
eyes and babbling lips, a wanderer in a world full of torturing
images&mdash;fountains of bubbling water which she longed to drink&mdash;great
black serpents, which came crawling in at the window, and creeping
nearer, nearer to her bed&mdash;wriggling, hideous forms that hemmed her
in on every side&mdash;giant staircases that she was always trying to
climb&mdash;mammoth caves in which she lost herself, fifty times bigger and
more awful than those serpentine caverns near the Lizard, which she and
Allegra had explored in the previous autumn&mdash;steeper, stonier than the
tall cliffs and pinnacled rocks above Bedruthan sands.</p>

<p>Day after day, night after night, Martin Disney sat in his place and
listened to those ravings of a mind distraught. He could not keep
himself from trying to follow her in that labyrinth of disconnected
fancies&mdash;visions of shapeless horror, trouble, confusion&mdash;a wild
babbling of numbers, prattling of millions, billions, trillions&mdash;as
if her days of health and sense had been spent in the calculations of
a Rothschild, she who could scarcely reckon the simplest account in a
tradesman's book.</p>

<p>What had she to do with this torturing recital of thousands and
millions, this everlasting heaping up of figures?</p>

<p>Then at another period of that long struggle between life and death,
reason and unreason, she had a ghastly vision of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> children,
squatting on each side of her bed, one living, the other dead, a grisly
child with throat cut from ear to ear. Again and again she implored
them to take away those babies&mdash;the dead child whose horrid aspect
froze her blood&mdash;the living child that grinned and made faces at her.</p>

<p>Once and once only during that season of delirium the elder of her
nurses carried the baby to her bedside, the tiny form in snowy
cambric and lace, a little roseate face, on which the first glimmer
of intelligence was already dawning, sweet blue eyes that smiled at
the light, rosebud lips that invited kisses. The nurse took the infant
to the side of the bed, and asked the young mother to look at him.
Those fever-bright eyes stared at the sweet small face with a gaze of
ever-growing horror, and then with a wild shriek Isola clasped her
hands before her eyes, and drew herself cowering to the further side of
the bed.</p>

<p>"The dead child!" she cried. "Why do you show me that dead child? Don't
you see his throat streaming with blood?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a case in which the nurses had no easy duty by day or night; and
there were times when Disney insisted that the night-nurse should have
extra rest, while he kept guard.</p>

<p>"But if she should be very bad, sir, you might not be able to manage."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I should. My sister is a very light sleeper. She would come to
me in a moment, and she has a great deal of influence with my wife."</p>

<p>This was true. From the beginning of evil Allegra's presence had
exercised a soothing power. She had been able to lull the patient
to sleep sometimes, when opiates had failed to produce even fitful
slumber. Isola was calmer and less restless when her sister-in-law was
by her side.</p>

<p>In those long night watches, sometimes in solitude, Martin Disney had
ample leisure in which to ponder upon his wedded life, and to consider
how far the hopes with which he had entered upon that life had been
realized. The retrospect left him melancholy, and with a latent sense
of loss and dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>appointment; and yet he told himself again and again
that he did ill to be dissatisfied, that Providence had dealt kindly
with him.</p>

<p>At five and forty years of age, he, Martin Disney, of modest fortune
and social status, and of no especial claim to be admired, intellectual
or physical, had won the hand of a lovely and interesting girl. He had
been so bewildered and overcome by the delight of his conquest, that
he had entered upon no laborious process of self-examination before he
took to himself this fair and winning partner. It had been enough for
him that she came to him willingly, lovingly, in all truth and girlish
simplicity, loyal as she was pure. He had never asked himself could
such an attachment last&mdash;on her side? It had been enough for him that
the love existed. It would be his duty and his delight to strengthen
the bond, to draw that fair spirit into closer union with his own. He
had felt no shadow of fear for the future. Once having won her, it must
be easy to keep his treasure&mdash;easy for him who would so faithfully
guard and cherish this priceless gift of a benign Providence. He was
a man of deep religious feeling&mdash;a man who recognized in good and
evil, in joy and in sorrow, the dealings of an Almighty God with
His short-sighted creatures. He accepted his happiness in fear and
trembling, knowing the instability of all mortal joys; but he had never
feared the loss of Isola's love.</p>

<p>Yet now, sitting in the deep of night beside that bed which might be
the bed of death, he told himself that his wife's love was lost to him,
had been lost from the hour of his return to Trelasco, when he went
back to her with all the enthusiasm of a lover, forgetful of his mature
years, of his long experience of life&mdash;hard fighting, hard knocks of
all kinds in the great life-battle.</p>

<p>He had gone back to her as Leander to Hero, a boy in heart and
hopefulness; and what had he found in her? A placid, obedient wife,
gentle almost to apathy, but with a strain of melancholy underlying all
their relations which his devoted love could not conquer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>To all his interrogations her answer had been the same. She was not
unhappy. She had everything in life that she desired. There was
nothing that he could give her, no possible change in their existence
which could add to her content. All this should mean domestic peace,
a heart at ease; yet all this was unsatisfying to Martin Disney; for
his instinct told him that his wife was not happy&mdash;that the element of
gladness was, for some inscrutable reason, banished from her life.</p>

<p>She had seemed happier, or at least the little home had been brighter
and gayer after Allegra's coming; but as the time wore on it became
clear to him that the life and gaiety were all in Allegra herself,
and that Isola was spiritless and depressed. It was as if the spring
of her life had snapped suddenly, and left her nerveless and joyless,
a submissive, unhopeful creature. That sense of disappointment and
loss which he had dimly felt, even when his home-coming had been a new
thing, had grown and deepened with the passage of time. He had bought
his land; he had added to the space and comfort of his house; he had
enlarged the stables, and bought a couple of hunters, and a cob for
harness; and while these things had been doing, the activity of his
days, the fuss and labour of arrangement and supervision, had occupied
his mind so pleasantly as to stifle those growing doubts for the time
being. But when all was done; when the vine and the figtree had been
planted, and he sat down to take his ease in their shade, then he began
to feel very keenly that his wife's part in all that he had done was
the part of submission only. She liked this or that because he liked
it. She was content, and that was all. And the line between contentment
and resignation is so faint a demarcation that it seemed to him
sometimes as if she were only resigned, as if she suffered life rather
than lived&mdash;suffered life as holy women suffer some slow, wasting
disease, in meek subjection to a mysterious decree.</p>

<p>He sat beside her bed, while she battled with all the demons of
delirium; and he wondered whether&mdash;when she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> at her best, when
her mind had been brightest and clearest&mdash;she had been any nearer to
him than she was now in her madness; whether he had known any more of
her inner self&mdash;the mystery of her heart and conscience&mdash;than he knew
now, while those wild eyes stared at him without sight or knowledge.</p>

<p>One summer morning, as he sat alone in his watch in that dull interval
between darkness and dawn, the visions of the wandering mind took a
more consecutive form than usual. She fancied herself in a storm at
sea. The waves were rolling mountains high&mdash;were bearing down upon her
with threatenings of instant death. She feared, and yet she courted
the danger. In one minute she was recoiling from the wild rush of
waters, clinging distractedly to the brass rail at the head of her bed,
crouching against the wall as if to save herself from an advancing
wave; and in the next minute she sprang out of bed, and rushed to the
open window, wanting to throw herself out of it. Disney was only just
quick enough to seize her in his arms, and carry her back to bed. He
held her there, battling with him in a vehement effort to escape from
his restraining arms.</p>

<p>"Why do you stop me?" she cried, looking at him fiercely with her
distracted eyes. "What else is there for me? What other refuge? what
other hope? Let me go! let me go! Cruel! cruel! cruel! Let me throw
myself into the sea! Don't you understand? Oh, cruel! cruel! Cold and
wicked, shameless and cruel! There is nothing else&mdash;only that refuge
left! Let me hide myself in death! let me hide&mdash;hide!"</p>

<p>Her voice rose to a shriek; and both the nurse and Allegra came
hurrying in. The faint white dawn shone upon her livid face and on the
scarlet spot upon each hollow cheek. Her eyes stared wildly, starting
from their sockets in that paroxysm of her madness.</p>

<p>Only a few days after that night of terror Isola was lying calm as
a child. The fever had gone down&mdash;the enfeebled constitution had at
last answered to the influence of medicine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> and gradually, like the
slow lifting of the darkness after a long night of cloud and fog,
consciousness and reason came back. Sleep soothed the strained and
weary nerves, and the exhausted frame, which a few days before had
seemed endowed with a superhuman strength, lay like a log upon the bed
of sickness.</p>

<p>Recovery was slow, but there was no relapse. Slow as the dawning of day
to the tired watcher, after the long, blank night, there came the dawn
of maternal love. The young mother began to take delight in her child;
and it was rapture to Martin Disney to see her sitting opposite him
under the tulip-tree, in the low Madeira chair, with her baby in her
lap. Allegra vied with her in her devotion to that over-praised infant;
while the Shah and Tim, of the same opinion for the first time in their
lives, were almost rabid with jealousy.</p>

<p>They all lived in the garden in that happy summer season, as they had
done the year before, when Allegra first came among them. It was in the
garden they received their visitors, and it was there that Mr. Colfox
came at least thrice a week, upon the flimsiest pretexts of parish
business, to drink tea poured out for him by Allegra's helpful hands,
while Isola sat quietly by, listening to their talk, and watching every
change in her child's face; from smiles to frowns, from slumber to
waking.</p>

<p>Allegra had taken kindly to parish work, and, in Mr. Colfox's own
phraseology, was a tower of strength to him in his labours among the
poor of Trelasco. She had started a series of mothers' meetings in
the winter afternoons, and had read to the women and girls while they
worked, helping them a good deal with their work into the bargain.
She had done wonders at penny readings, singing, reciting, drawing
lightning caricatures of local celebrities with bits of coloured chalk
on rough white paper. Her portrait of Vansittart Crowther had been
applauded to the echo, although it was not a flattering portrait. She
had visited the sick; she had taught in the night school. The curate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
had been enthusiastic in his appreciation of her, and his praises had
been listened to contemptuously by the two Miss Crowthers, each of whom
at different periods had taken up these good works, only to drop them
again after the briefest effort.</p>

<p>"She will get tired as soon as we did," said Alicia, "when she finds
out how impossible these creatures are&mdash;unless she has an ulterior
motive."</p>

<p>"What ulterior motive should she have?" asked Colfox, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Who can tell? She may want to get herself talked about. As Miss
Leland, of the Angler's Nest, a sort of useful companion to her
brother's wife, she is a nobody. If she can get a reputation for piety
and philanthropy, that will be better than nothing. Or she may be only
angling for a husband."</p>

<p>"If you knew her as well as I do you would know that she is above all
trivial and selfish motives, and that she is good to these people
because her heart has gone out to them."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you see we don't know her. Her brother has chosen to hold
himself aloof from Glenaveril; and I must say I am very glad he has
taken that line&mdash;for more than one reason."</p>

<p>"If any of your reasons concern Miss Leland you are very much mistaken
in under-rating her. You could not have had a more delightful
companion," said Mr. Colfox, with some warmth.</p>

<p>"Oh, we all know that you have exalted her into a heroine&mdash;a St. John's
Wood St. Helena. But she is a little too unconventional for my taste;
though I certainly would rather be intimate with her than with her
sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"Surely you have no fault to find with that most gentle creature?"</p>

<p>"She is just a little too gentle for my taste," replied Alicia, who
usually took upon herself all expression of opinion, while Belinda
fanned herself languidly, in an æsthetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> attitude, feeling that her
chief mission in this life was to sit still and look like <i>la belle
dame sans merci</i>. "She is just as much too quiet as Miss Leland is too
boisterous. I have no liking for pensive young women who cast down
their eyelids at the slightest provocation, and are only animated when
they are flirting."</p>

<p>"The tongue is a little member," quoted Mr. Colfox, taking up his hat,
and holding out his hand in adieu.</p>

<p>He was very unceremonious to these fair parishioners of his, and talked
to them as freely as if he had been an old French Abbé in a country
village. It is needless to say that they valued his opinion so much the
more because he was entirely unaffected by their wealth or their good
looks. They were naturally aggrieved at his marked admiration for Miss
Leland.</p>

<p>Those ripe months of harvest and vintage, July, August, and September,
passed like a blissful dream for Martin Disney. He had snatched his
darling from the jaws of death. He had her once more&mdash;fair to look
upon, with sweet, smiling mouth and pensive eyes; and she was so tender
and so loving to him, in fond gratitude for his devotion during her
illness, so seemingly happy in their mutual love for their child, that
he forgot all those aching fears which had gnawed his heart while he
sat by her pillow through the long anxious nights&mdash;forgot that he had
ever doubted her, or remembered his doubts only to scorn himself as a
morbid, jealous fool. Could he doubt her, who was candour and innocence
personified? Could he think for an instant that all those sweet, loving
ways and looks of hers which beautified his commonplace existence, were
so much acting&mdash;and that her heart was not his? No! True love has an
unmistakable language; and true love spoke to him in every word and
tone of his wife's.</p>

<p>The child made so close a bond between them. Both lives were seemingly
bound and entwined about this fragile life of Isola's firstborn. Mr.
Baynham had no reason now to complain of his patient's want of the
maternal instinct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> He had rather to restrain her in her devotion to
the child. He had to reprove her for her sleepless nights and morbid
anxieties.</p>

<p>"Do you think your baby will grow any the faster or stronger for your
lying awake half the night worrying yourself about him?" said the
doctor, with his cheery bluntness. "He has a capital nurse&mdash;one of
those excellent cow-women, who are specially created to rear other
people's babies; and he has a doctor who is not quite a fool about
infant maladies. Read your novels, Mrs. Disney, and keep up your good
looks; or else twenty years hence you will see your son blushing when
he hears his mother mistaken for his grandmother."</p>

<p>After giving his patient this advice, Mr. Baynham told his wife, in
confidence, that were anything to happen to the little one, Isola
Disney would go off her head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she is sadly hysterical," replied Mrs. Baynham. "I am very
fond of her, you know, Tom; but I have never been able to understand
her. I can't make out a young woman who has a pretty house and an
indulgent husband, and who never seems quite happy."</p>

<p>"Every woman can't have your genial disposition, Belle," answered the
doctor, admiringly. "Perpetual sunshine is the rarest thing in Nature."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The early western harvest had been gathered in. Upland and valley in
that undulating land were clothed with the tawny hue of the stubble.
Here and there the plough horses were moving slowly along the red
ridges on the steep hillside. No touch of frost had dulled the rich
hues of the autumnal flowers, and the red carnations still glowed in
every cottage garden, while the pale pink trusses of hydrangea filled
all the shrubberies with beauty. A keener breath came up at eventide
from the salt sea beyond Point Neptune, and wilder winds crept across
the inland valleys with the on-coming of night. Summer and the swallows
were gone. October, a balmy season for the most part, was at hand;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and there were no more tea-drinkings and afternoon gossipings in the
garden at the Angler's Nest. The lamps were lighted before dinner. The
evenings were spent in the old library and the new drawing-room, the
new room communicating with the old one by a curtained archway, so that
of a night the curtains could be drawn back and Martin Disney could
sit among his books by the fireplace in the library, and yet be within
conversational reach of Isola and Allegra in the drawing-room, where
they had piano and table-easel, work-baskets, and occupations of all
kinds.</p>

<p>Mr. Colfox sometimes dropped in of an evening, on parish business of
course, took a cup of coffee, listened while Allegra played one of
Mozart's sonatas or sang a song by Gluck or Haydn or Handel. Mr. Colfox
was not one of the advanced people who despise Mozart or Handel. Nor
did he look down upon Haydn. Indeed, he sat and stroked his thin legs
with a sheepish appreciation, wrinkling up his loose trousers, and
showing a large amount of stocking, while Allegra sang "My mother bids
me bind my hair," in her clear, strong mezzo-soprano, which was of
infinite use to him in his choir.</p>

<p>He told everybody that Martin Disney's was an ideal household&mdash;a home
into which it was a privilege to be admitted.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I never knew the beauty of domestic life till I knew the
Angler's Nest," he said one evening after dinner at Glenaveril, when
he and the village doctor had accepted one of Mr. Crowther's pressing
invitations to what he called "pot-luck," the pot-luck of the man whose
spirit burns within him at the thought of his hundred-guinea cook, and
whose pride is most intolerable when it apes humility.</p>

<p>"Really, now," said Mr. Crowther, "you surprise me, for I have always
fancied there was a screw loose there."</p>

<p>"What does that expression imply, Mr. Crowther?" asked the curate,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know! Nothing specific: only one's notion of an ideal home
doesn't generally take the shape of a beautiful girl of twenty married
to a man of forty-five. The disparity is just twice as much as it ought
to be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon my soul," cried the curate, "I don't believe that wedded love is
affected by any difference of years. Desdemona loved Othello, who was a
man of mature age&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And black," interrupted Mr. Crowther, with a coarse laugh. "Well, let
us be thankful that Colonel Disney is not a nigger; and that there is
so much the less danger of a burst-up at the Angler's Nest. And now,
Baynham, with regard to this footpath across the wood, who the deuce
will be injured if I shut it up?"</p>

<p>"A good many people, and the people I think you would least like to
injure," answered the doctor, sturdily. "Old people, and feeble, ailing
people, who find the walk to church quite far enough even with the help
of that short cut."</p>

<p>"Short cut be hanged!" cried Mr. Crowther, helping himself to a bumper
of port, and passing on the decanter with hospitable emphasis. "It
can't make a difference of a hundred yards."</p>

<p>"It does make a difference of over a quarter of a mile&mdash;and the proof
is that everybody uses it, and that it goes by the name of the Church
path. I wouldn't try to stop it, if I were you, Mr. Crowther. You are
a popular man in the parish, for you&mdash;well, you have spent a heap of
money in this place, and you subscribe liberally to all our charities
and what not; but, I don't mind telling you, if you were to try and
shut off that old footpath across your wood, you'd be about the most
unpopular man within a radius of ten miles."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about trying to shut it off, man," said Mr. Crowther,
arrogantly. "If I choose to lock the gates to-morrow, I shall do it,
and ask nobody's leave. The wood is my wood, and there's no clause in
my title-deeds as to any right of way through it; and I don't see why I
am to have my hazel bushes pulled about, and my chestnut trees damaged
by a pack of idle boys, under the pretence of church-going. There's the
Queen's highway for 'em, d&mdash;n 'em!" cried Mr. Crowther, growing more
insolent, as he gulped his fifth glass of Sandemann. "If that ain't
good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> enough, let 'em go to the Ranters' Chapel at the other end of the
village."</p>

<p>"I thought you were a staunch Conservative, Mr. Crowther, and an
upholder of Church and State," said Mr. Colfox. "Am I to believe my
ears when I hear you advocating the Ranters' Chapel?"</p>

<p>"It's good enough for such rabble as that, sir. What does it matter
where they go?"</p>

<p>"Prosecute the boys for trespass, if you like," said the doctor;
"though I doubt if you'll get a magistrate to impose more than a
nominal fine for the offence of taking a handful of nuts in a wood that
has been open ever since I began to walk, and heaven knows how many
years before; but let the old gaffers and goodies creep to church by
the shortest path that can take them there. They'll have to travel by
the Queen's highway later, when they go to the churchyard&mdash;but then
they'll be carried. Don't interfere with the privileges of the poor,
Mr. Crowther. No one ever did that yet and went scot free. There's
always somebody to take up the cudgels for them."</p>

<p>"I don't care a doit for anybody's cudgels, Baynham. I shall have a
look at my title-deeds to-morrow; and if there's no stipulation about
the right of way, you'll find the gates locked next Sunday morning."</p>

<p>Sunday morning came, and the gates at each end of the old footpath
were still open, and nothing had come of Mr. Crowther's threat. Tho
gates had stood open so long, and were so old and rotten, their lower
timbers so embedded in the soft, oozy soil, so entangled and overgrown
with foxglove and fern, so encrusted with moss and lichen, that it
is doubtful if anybody could have closed them. They seemed as much
rooted in the ground as the great brown fir trunks which rose in rugged
majesty beside them.</p>

<p class="center">"WHERE THE COLD SEA RAVES."</p>


<p>In the keen, fresh October afternoons, there was no walk Allegra
loved better than the walk to Neptune Point, and higher up by winding
footpaths to the Rashleigh Mausoleum, fitting sepulchre for a race born
and bred in the breath of the sea; a stately tomb perched on a rocky
pinnacle at the end of a promontory, like a sea-bird's nest overhanging
the wave.</p>

<p>Allegra was in raptures with that strange resting-place.</p>

<p>"I like it ever so much better than your Cockneyfied cemetery," she
exclaimed. "Think how grand it must be to lie for ever within the sound
of the sea&mdash;the terrible, inscrutable sea, whose anger means death&mdash;the
calm, summer sea, whose waves come dancing up the sands like laughing
water. I wonder whether the Rashleighs would let me have a little grave
of my own somewhere among these crags and hillocks&mdash;a modest little
grave, hidden under wild foliage, which nobody would ever notice? Only
I should hear the sea just as well as they do in their marble tomb."</p>

<p>"Oh, Allegra, how can you talk so lightly of death?" said Isola,
shocked at this levity. "To me it is always dreadful to think of&mdash;and
yet it must come."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said Allegra, with infinite pity, putting her arm round
her sister-in-law's slighter figure, as they stood by the railing of
the Mausoleum, in the loveliness of an October sunset.</p>

<p>The sun had just gone down, veiled in autumnal haze, and behind the
long ridge of waters beyond the Dodman there glowed the deep crimson of
the western sky. Eastward above the Polruan hills the moon moved slowly
upward, amidst dark masses of cloud which melted and rolled away before
her on-coming, till all the sky became of one dark azure. The two girls
went down the hill in silence, Allegra holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> Isola's arm, linked
with her own, steadying those weaker footsteps with the strength of her
own firm movements. The difference between the two in physical force
was no less marked than the difference in their mental characteristics,
and Allegra's love for her sister-in-law was tempered with a tender
compassion for something so much weaker than herself.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" she repeated, as they moved slowly down the steep, narrow
path, "and do you really shudder at the thought of death? I don't. I
have only a vast curiosity. Do you remember that definition of Sir
Thomas Browne's which Martin read to us once&mdash;'Death is the Lucina
of life.' Death only opens the door of the hidden worlds which are
waiting for all of us to discover. It is only an appalling name for
a new birth. I love to dream about the infinite possibilities of the
future&mdash;just as a boy might dream of the time when he should become
a man. Look, look, Isa, there's a yacht coming in! Isn't it a lovely
sight?"</p>

<p>It was a long, narrow vessel, with all her canvas spread, gleaming with
a silvery whiteness in the moonlight. Slowly and with majestic motion
she swept round towards Neptune Point and the mouth of the harbour.
There was only the lightest wind, and the waves were breaking gently on
the rocks at the base of the promontory&mdash;a night as calm and fair as
June.</p>

<p>"Look!" repeated Allegra, "isn't she lovely? like a fairy boat. Whose
yacht can she be, I wonder? She looks like a racer, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>Isola did not answer. She had seen such a yacht two years ago; had seen
such a long, narrow hull lying in the harbour under repairs; had seen
the same craft sailing out to Mevagissey on a trial trip in the wintry
sunlight. Doubtless there were many yachts in this world of just the
same build and character.</p>

<p>They stood at an angle of the hill-path looking up the river, and saw
the yacht take in her canvas as she came into the haven under the
hill; that sheltered harbour, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> two rivers cleaving the hills
asunder, one winding away to the right towards Lerrin, the other to the
left towards Trelasco and Lostwithiel. It looked so perfect a place of
shelter, so utterly safe from tempest or foul weather; and yet there
were seasons when a fierce wind from the great Atlantic came sweeping
up the deep valleys, and all the angry spirits of the ocean seemed at
war in that narrow gorge. To-night the atmosphere was unusually calm,
and Isola could hear the sailors singing at their work.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly the two young women went down the hill, Allegra full of
speculation and wonderment about the unknown vessel, Isola curiously
silent. As they neared the hotel a man landed from a dinghy, and came
briskly up the slippery causeway&mdash;a tall, slim figure in the vivid
moonlight, loose limbed, loosely clad, moving with easiest motion.</p>

<p>Isola turned sick at the sight of him. She stopped, helplessly,
hopelessly, and stood staring straight before her, watching him as he
came nearer and nearer, nearer and nearer&mdash;like some awful figure in
a nightmare dream, when the feet of the dreamer seem frozen to the
ground, and flesh and blood seem changed to ice and stone.</p>

<p>He came nearer, looked at them, and passed them by&mdash;passed as one who
knew them not, and was but faintly curious about them. He passed and
walked quickly up towards the Point, with the rapid swinging movements
of one who was glad to tread the solid earth.</p>

<p>No, it was not Lostwithiel. She had thought at first that no one else
could look so like him at so short a distance; no one else could have
that tall, slender figure, and easy, buoyant walk. But the face she saw
in the moonlight was not his. It was like, but not the same: darker,
with larger features, a face of less delicacy and distinction; but oh,
God! how like the eyes that had looked at her, with that brief glance
of casual inspection, were to those other eyes that had poured their
passionate story into her own that unforgotten night when she sat out
the after-supper waltzes in the ante-room at the Talbot. She could not
have believed that any man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> living could so recall the man whose name
she never spoke of her own free will.</p>

<p>There were some sailors standing about at the top of the steep little
bit of road leading down to the granite causeway, and their voices
sounded fresh and clear in the still evening, mixed with the rippling
rush of the water as it came running up the stones. The moonlight shone
full upon one of the men as he stood with his face towards the sea, and
Isola read the name upon the front of his jersey.</p>

<p>"<i>Vendetta.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Vendetta</i>," cried Allegra, quick to observe the name. "Why, is not
that Lord Lostwithiel's yacht?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think so," faltered Isola.</p>

<p>"Then that must have been Lord Lostwithiel who passed as just now; and
yet you would have known him, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"That was not Lord Lostwithiel."</p>

<p>"A friend of his, I suppose; such a nice-looking man, too. There was
something so frank and cheery in his look as he just glanced at us both
and marched briskly on. He did not pay us the compliment of seeming
curious. I wonder who he is?"</p>

<p>Isola was wondering about something else. She was looking with a
frightened gaze across the harbour, towards that one break in the long
golden trail of the moonbeams where the <i>Vendetta</i> cast her shadow on
the water. There were lamps gleaming brightly here and there upon the
vessel&mdash;a look of occupation.</p>

<p>"Is Lord Lostwithiel on board his yacht?" Allegra asked of one of the
sailors, not ashamed to appear inquisitive.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; Mr. Hulbert is skipper."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Hulbert?"</p>

<p>"His lordship's brother."</p>

<p>"Was that he who went up towards the Point just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Is he going to stop here long, do you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he knows himself, ma'am. It'll depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> upon the weather
most likely. If we get a fair wind we may be off to the Lizard at an
hour's notice, and away up north to the Hebrides."</p>

<p>"Doesn't that seem inconsistent?" exclaimed Allegra, as they walked
homewards. "What is the good of coming to Cornwall if he wants to go to
the Hebrides? It must be very much out of his way."</p>

<p>"He may want to see his old home, perhaps. He was born at the Mount,
you know."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I don't know anything about him, but I want to know ever so
much. I call it an interesting face."</p>

<p>Allegra was full of animation during the homeward walk. A stranger
of any kind must needs be a God-send, as affording a subject for
conversation; but such a stranger as Lostwithiel's brother afforded
a theme of strongest interest. She had heard so much about Lord
Lostwithiel and all his works and ways&mdash;the pity of it that he did not
marry; the still greater pity that he did not live at the Mount, and
give shooting parties and spend money in the neighbourhood. She had
heard in a less exalted key of his lordship's younger brother, who had
fought under Beresford in Egypt, and who had only lately left the navy.
What more natural than that such a man should sail his brother's yacht?</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert was still unmarried; but no one talked about the pity
of that. People took a severely sensible view of his case, and were
unanimous in the opinion that he could not afford to marry, and that
any inspiration in that line would be criminal on his part. There was
an idea at Trelasco that the younger sons of peers of moderate fortune
have been specially designed by Providence to keep up the race of
confirmed bachelors. There must be bachelors; the world cannot get on
without them; society requires them as a distinct element in social
existence; and it would ill become the offshoots of the peerage to
shrink from fulfilling their destiny.</p>

<p>Allegra was not the less curious about Captain Hulbert, although
his celibate mission had been frequently expounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> to her. She
was interested in him because she liked his face, because he was
Lostwithiel's brother, because he was sailing a very beautiful yacht,
because he had appeared in her life with a romantic suddenness, sailing
out of the sea unheralded and unexpected, like a man who had dropped
from the moon.</p>

<p>She fell asleep that night wondering if she would ever see him
again&mdash;if the <i>Vendetta</i> would have vanished from the harbour to-morrow
at noontide, like a boat that had only lived in her dreams; or whether
the yacht would still be anchored there in the haven under the hill.
And, if so, whether Captain Hulbert would call at the Angler's Nest,
and tell them about Lostwithiel's South American adventures, and how he
came to be skipper of his brother's yacht.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At breakfast next morning, Colonel Disney's talk was chiefly about
Captain Hulbert. The colonel had been for an early walk, and had
seen the <i>Vendetta</i> from the little Quay at Fowey, by the Mechanics'
Institute, and had heard who was the skipper.</p>

<p>"I remember him when he and his brother were at Eton together&mdash;nice
boys&mdash;capital boys, both of them&mdash;but I liked Jack Hulbert better than
Lostwithiel. He was franker, more spontaneous and impulsive. Yes, Jack
was my favourite, and everybody else's favourite, I think, when the two
were boys. I saw very little of them after they grew up. I was away
with my regiment, and Jack was away with his ship, and Lostwithiel was
wandering up and down the earth, like Satan. I left a card for Captain
Hulbert at the club, asking him to dinner this evening. You don't mind,
do you, Isola?"</p>

<p>Isola had no objection to offer, and Allegra was delighted at the
prospect of seeing more of the man with the nice frank countenance, and
that seafaring air which most women like.</p>

<p>"I am a dreadful person for being influenced by first impressions," she
said, "and that one glance at Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> Hulbert in the moonlight assures
me that I shall like him."</p>

<p>"Don't like him too well," said Martin, laughingly, "for I'm afraid
he's a detrimental, and would make even a worse match than Colfox, who
may be a bishop one day, while Hulbert has left the navy, and is never
likely to be anything."</p>

<p>"Match! detrimental!" cried Allegra, indignantly. "Can it be my brother
who talks in such a vulgar strain? As if a woman could not look at a
man without thinking of marrying him!"</p>

<p>"Some women can't," answered Martin. "With them every free man is a
possible husband&mdash;indeed, I believe there are some who cannot look at a
married man without estimating the chances of the divorce court&mdash;if the
man is what they call a catch."</p>

<p>"That is your Indian experience!" exclaimed Allegra, scornfully. "I
have heard that India is a sink of iniquity."</p>

<p>She went about her day's varied work as usual&mdash;curious to see the new
acquaintance&mdash;yet in no wise excited. Vivid and animated, enthusiastic
and energetic as she was in all her thoughts and ways, gushing
sentimentality made no part of Miss Leland's character. Life at
Trelasco flowed with such an even monotony, there was such a dearth of
new interests, that it was only natural that a girl of vivacious temper
should be curious about new-comers. At St. John's Wood every day had
brought some new element into the lives of the students, and almost
every day had brought a new pupil, drawn thither by the growing renown
of the school, pupils from the uttermost ends of the earth sometimes,
pupils of swart complexion speaking unknown tongues, pupils patrician
and pupils plebeian, each and all conforming to the same stringent
rules of art, spending patient months in the shading of a brace of
plums or a bunch of grapes, from a plaster cast, and toiling slowly up
the gradual ascent which leads to the Royal Academy and the gold medal.
Many there were who sickened at the slow rate of progress and who fell
away. Only the faithful remained. And this going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> and coming, this
strife between faith and unfaith, patience and impatience, had made
a perpetual movement in the life of the great school&mdash;to say nothing
of such bodily activities as lawn tennis, for which the master had
provided a court&mdash;a court for his girl-pupils, be it noted, where they
played among themselves, as if they had been so many collegians in the
college of Tennyson's "Princess."</p>

<p>Allegra had liked her life at the great art school, but she had never
regretted its abandonment. She loved her brother, and her brother's
wife, better even than she loved art. It was only now and then that she
felt that existence at Trelasco was as monotonous as the flow of the
river going up and coming down day by day between Lostwithiel and the
sea.</p>

<p>She spent the hours between breakfast and luncheon hard at work in her
painting-room&mdash;a little room with a large window facing northward. She
had the coachman's girl and boy for her models, and was engaged upon
a little water-colour picture after the school of Mrs. Allingham, a
little picture which told its story with touching simplicity.</p>

<p>It was not the first picture of the kind she had painted. Several
of her works had been exhibited at the minor galleries which are
hospitable to the new-comer in the world of art; and two small pictures
had been bought at prices which seemed to promise her an easy road to
fortune.</p>

<p>Tho coachman's children profited greatly by this new profession which
had been devised for them. Allegra made their frocks in her leisure
hours, when the active fingers must have something to do, while the
active tongue ran on gaily in happy talk with Martin and Isola. Allegra
made up to her little models for their hours of enforced idleness by
extra tuition which kept them ahead of most of the other pupils in the
village school; and Allegra supplied them with pocket-money.</p>

<p>"I don't know however the children got on before Miss Leland came,"
said the coachman's wife. "They seem to look to her for everything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Allegra had other models, village children, and village girls&mdash;her
beauty-girl, a baker's daughter with a splendid semi-Greek face,
like Mrs. Langtry's, whom she dressed up in certain cast-off finery
of her own, and painted in her genre pictures, now in this attitude,
and now in that, imparting an air of distinction which elevated the
Cornish peasant into a patrician. She it was, this baker's fair-haired
daughter, who stood for Allegra's successful picture&mdash;"A daughter of
the gods, divinely tall," a little bit of finished painting which had
brought the painter five and thirty guineas&mdash;boundless wealth as it
seemed to her&mdash;and ever so many commissions.</p>

<p>Art, even in despondency and failure, is a consolation; art successful
is an intoxicating delight. Allegra was as happy a young woman as could
be found in Cornwall that day, when she shut her colour-box, dismissed
her little maiden, and ran down to lunch, where she found Isola more
silent than usual, and made amends by her own light-hearted chatter
for the morning's absorption over the easel. After lunch she ran off
to the village to pay her parish visits to the sick and old, and on
her way to an outlying cottage she met Mr. Colfox, who immediately
turned to accompany her, a way he had, but a way to which she had never
attached any significance. He was a clever, well-read man, of somewhat
original temper, who had to pass most of his life among unlettered or
dull people; therefore it surprised Allegra in no wise that he should
like to talk to her. A bright, attractive girl of three and twenty is
very unsuspicious about the feelings of a homely looking man at least a
dozen years her senior.</p>

<p>"Your brother has been good enough to ask me to dinner," he said, after
a little talk about the Goodies and their ailments. "I met him at the
club this morning."</p>

<p>"He wants you to meet Captain Hulbert. Perhaps you know him already?"</p>

<p>"No, he has not been here within my time. He only left the navy a year
ago, and he was generally stationed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> utmost ends of the earth,
keeping guard over our remote possessions. Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Only for an instant. He passed my sister and me yesterday evening in
the moonlight. I thought he looked a nice person&mdash;but I think women
have a natural leaning towards sailors. I could never imagine a seaman
telling a falsehood or doing a mean action."</p>

<p>"There is a kind of open-air manner which suggests truthfulness,"
admitted Mr. Colfox. "Yet there have been dark deeds done by sailors;
there have been black sheep even in the Queen's Navee. However, I
believe Captain Hulbert is worthy of your good opinion. I have never
heard anybody speak against him, and the old people who knew him as a
lad seem to have liked him better than Lord Lostwithiel."</p>

<p>"Do tell me your opinion of Lord Lostwithiel. I am very curious
about him. Mr. Crowther talked of him so much the night we were at
Glenaveril."</p>

<p>"Mr. Crowther loves a lord."</p>

<p>"Please satisfy my curiosity. Is he really such a fascinating
personage?"</p>

<p>"He has very pleasant manners. I don't know what constitutes
fascination in a man, though I know pretty well what it means in a
woman. Lord Lostwithiel's manners are chiefly distinguished by repose
without languor or affectation&mdash;and by an interest in other people so
cleverly simulated that it deceives everybody. One finds him out by the
way in which people boast of his friendship. He cannot be so attached
to all the world. He has a manner which is generally described as
sympathetic."</p>

<p>"Mr. Crowther enlarged a good deal upon his lordship's admiration for
my sister at the Hunt Ball. Was that so very marked?"</p>

<p>Mr. Colfox coloured violently at this direct question&mdash;assuredly not
easy to answer truthfully without hazard of offence.</p>

<p>"I was not at the ball&mdash;I&mdash;I heard people talk a little&mdash;in the way
people talk of everything&mdash;about Lostwithiel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> attention to Mrs.
Disney, and about her prettiness&mdash;they all agreed that if not the
loveliest woman in the room, she was at least the most interesting."</p>

<p>"It was very natural that he should admire her; but I don't think
Martin liked Mr. Crowther's talking about it in that way, at the
dinner-table. The man is horridly underbred. Has Lord Lostwithiel what
you call&mdash;" she hesitated a little&mdash;"a good character?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about the present. I have heard that in the past his
reputation was not altogether good."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Allegra, quickly. "The admiration of such a man is
an insult; and that is why Mr. Crowther harped upon the fact. I am sure
he is a malevolent man."</p>

<p>"Don't be hard upon him, Miss Leland. I believe he has only the
misfortune to be a cad&mdash;a cad by birth, education, and associations.
Don't fling your stone at such a man&mdash;consider what an unhappy fate it
is."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he does not think himself unhappy. He is bursting with
self-importance and the pride of riches. He is the typical rich man of
the Psalmist. He must be the happiest man in Trelasco, a thick-skinned
man whom nothing can hurt."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you think so badly of poor Mr. Crowther, because I am
really attached to his wife. She is one of the best women I know."</p>

<p>"So my sister tells me, and I was very much taken with her myself, but
one cannot afford to be friendly with Mrs. Crowther at the cost of
knowing her husband."</p>

<p>She spoke with some touch of the insolence of youth, which sets so
high a value upon its own opinions and its own independence, and
looks upon all the rest of humanity as upon a lower plane. And this
arrogant youth, which thinks so meanly of the multitude, will make
its own exceptions, and reverence its chosen ideals with a blind
hero-worship&mdash;for its love is always an upward-looking love, "the
desire of the moth for the star."</p>

<p>Mr. Colfox sighed, and smiled at the same moment, a sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> little
half-cynical smile. He was thinking how impossible it was to refrain
from admiring this bright out-spoken girl, with her quick intellect,
and her artistic instincts, so spiritual, so unworldly, and fresh as an
April morning&mdash;how impossible not to admire, how difficult not to love
her, and how hopeless to love.</p>

<p>He thought of himself with scathing self-contempt&mdash;middle-aged, homely
of feature and of figure, with nothing to recommend him except good
birth, a small independence&mdash;just so much as enabled him to live where
he pleased and serve whom he would, without reference to the stipend
attached to the cure; and a little rusty, dry-as-dust learning. Nothing
more than this; and he wanted to win and wed a girl whose image never
recurred to his mind without the suggestion of a rose garden, or a
summer morning. Yes, she reminded him of morning and dewy red roses,
those old-fashioned heavy red roses, round as a cup, and breathing
sweetest, purest perfume.</p>

<p>He jogged on by her side in silence, and only awoke from his reverie to
bid her good-bye at the gate of a cottage garden, in the lane that led
up the hill to Tywardreath.</p>

<p class="center">"FAR, TOO FAR OFF FOR THOUGHT OR ANY PRAYER."</p>


<p>Mr. Colfox and Allegra met again in the drawing-room of the Angler's
Nest at a quarter to eight. He was the first to arrive, and Isola had
not yet appeared. Martin Disney was at his post in front of the library
fireplace, library and drawing-room making one spacious room, lighted
with candles here and there, and with one large shaded lamp on a table
near the piano. Isola had been suffering from headache, and had been
late in dressing. Captain Hulbert had been in the room nearly ten
minutes before his hostess appeared, looking pale and ill in her black
lace gown, and with an anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> expression in her eyes. He had been
introduced to Allegra, and was talking to her as if he had known her
for years, when his attention was called off by Isola's appearance, and
his introduction to her.</p>

<p>Was this Martin Disney's wife, he thought wonderingly&mdash;such a
girlish fragile creature&mdash;so unlike the woman he had pictured to
himself? Strange that Lostwithiel should not have told him of her
delicate prettiness, seeing that he was a connoisseur in beauty, and
hypercritical.</p>

<p>"This is just the kind of beauty he would admire," thought Hulbert,
"something out of the common&mdash;a pale, spiritual beauty&mdash;not dependent
upon colouring, or even upon regularity of feature&mdash;the kind of thing
one calls soul, not having found a better name for it."</p>

<p>They went in to dinner presently, Captain Hulbert and Isola, Mr. Colfox
and Allegra. Tho table was a small oval, at which five people made a
snug little party. There was a central mass of white chrysanthemums,
a cheerful glow of coloured Venetian glass, delicatest pink and
jade-green, under the light of a hanging lamp. John Hulbert looked
round him with a pleased expression, taking in the flowers, the glass,
the cream-white china, the lamplight, everything; and then the two fair
young faces, one pale and pensive, the other aglow with the delight of
life, eagerly expectant of new ideas.</p>

<p>They talked of the <i>Vendetta</i> and the places at which she had touched
lately. Captain Hulbert had spent his summer on the Eastern Liguria,
between Genoa and Civita Vecchia.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it the wrong time of year for Italy?" asked Mr. Colfox.</p>

<p>"No, it is the season of seasons in the land of the sun. If you want to
enjoy a southern country, go there in the summer. The south is made for
summer, her houses are built for hot weather, her streets are planned
for shade; her wines, her food, her manners and customs have all been
made for summer-time&mdash;not for winter. If you want to know Italy at her
worst go there in cold weather."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did you leave Lord Lostwithiel?" Disney asked presently.</p>

<p>"I left him nowhere. He left me to rove about Southern Europe&mdash;left me
on his way to Carinthia. He is like the wandering Jew. He used to be
mad about yachting; but he got sick of the <i>Vendetta</i> all of a sudden,
and handed her over to me. Very generous on his part; but the boat is
something of a white elephant for a man of my small means. I wanted him
to sell her. Wouldn't hear of it. To let her. Not to be thought of.
'I'll lend her to you,' he said, 'and you shall keep her as long as you
like&mdash;sink her, if you like&mdash;provided you don't go down in her. She is
not a lucky boat.'"</p>

<p>"Have you sailed her long?"</p>

<p>"Nearly a year, and I love her as if she were bone of my bone, and
flesh of my flesh. Let us all go for a sail to-morrow, Mrs. Disney&mdash;to
Mevagissey or thereabouts. We could do a little fishing. It will be
capital fun. What do you say, Miss Leland?"</p>

<p>"I should adore it," said Allegra, beaming at him. "The sea is my
passion&mdash;and I think it is my sister's passion too. We are a kind of
amphibious creatures, living more on water than on land. We venture as
far as we dare in a row-boat&mdash;but oh, that is such a little way."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that some day you will venture so far that you won't be
able to get back again, and will find yourselves drifting away to
America," said her brother.</p>

<p>Isola answered never a word, until Captain Hulbert addressed her
pointedly for the second time.</p>

<p>"Will you go, Mrs. Disney&mdash;may we make up the party?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not," she answered, without looking at him.</p>

<p>"But why not? Are you such a bad sailor&mdash;in spite of all Miss Leland
says of you?"</p>

<p>"I am a pretty good sailor in a row-boat&mdash;but not in a yacht. And I
hate fishing&mdash;such a slow weary business. I would rather not go."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry; but you must not be worried about it,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> said Hulbert,
kindly, seeing the growing distress in her countenance. "We will not
go in for fishing&mdash;or excursions&mdash;but you and Miss Leland will at
least come to afternoon tea on the <i>Vendetta</i>&mdash;to afternoon tea in the
harbour. There used to be a comic song when I was a boy&mdash;'Come and
drink tea in the arbour.' You must come to the arbour with an aspirate.
It is not so rustic or sentimental&mdash;but there will be no earwigs or
creeping things to drop into your tea-cup. Mr. Colfox, you will come,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," answered the curate. "I have a sneaking
kindness for all yachts."</p>

<p>The conversation drifted back to Lostwithiel and his works and ways,
presently.</p>

<p>"When he went home two years ago he gave me to understand he was going
to settle down at the Mount, and spend the rest of his days in peace
and respectability," said Captain Hulbert. "Yet, very soon afterwards,
he and his yacht were off again like the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>, and the
next I heard of him was at Leghorn, and six months later he was
coasting off Algiers; and the following spring he was in South America;
and the <i>Vendetta</i> was laid up at Marseilles, where he begged me to go
and look after her, and take her to myself until such time as he should
want her again. I was with him for a few days at Leghorn, where he
seemed ill and out of spirits. I don't think you can have used him over
well in this part of the world, Mrs. Disney," he added, half in jest.
"I fancy some of you must have snubbed him severely, or his tenants
must have worried him by their complaints and exactions. I could not
get him to talk about his life at the Mount. He seemed to have taken a
disgust for the old home."</p>

<p>"You must put that down to his roving temper," said Disney, "for
although I was away at the time, I can answer for it there was no such
thing as snubbing in the case. Your brother is the only peer in these
parts, and from the way people talk about him he might be the only
peer in Great Britain&mdash;the Alpha and Omega of Debrett. Our parvenu
neighbour, Mr. Crowther, talked of him one night with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> slavish
rapture which made me sick. I am a Tory by association and instinct,
but I can't stand the vulgarian's worship of a lord."</p>

<p>Isola looked at her sister-in-law, and they both rose at this moment,
the Church almost tumbling over the Navy in eagerness to open the door;
Navy winning by a neck.</p>

<p>They were not long alone in the drawing-room, not more than the space
of a single cigarette, before the men followed. Then came music, and
a good deal of talk, in the long, low, spacious room, which looked so
bright and homely by candlelight, with all its tokens of domestic and
intellectual life.</p>

<p>"What a capital quarter-deck this is," cried John Hulbert, after pacing
up and down while he listened, and talked, and laughed at Allegra's
little jokes about the narrowness of village life. "It is delightful
to stretch one's legs in such a room as this, after six months upon a
yacht."</p>

<p>"You will have room enough to stretch your legs at the Mount," said
Disney.</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert had announced his intention of spending a week or two
under the family roof-tree while the <i>Vendetta</i> underwent some slight
repairs and renovations.</p>

<p>"Room enough and to spare," he said. "I shan't feel half so jovial
walking up and down those grim old rooms as I feel here. I shall
fancy a ghost pacing behind me, clump, clump, clump&mdash;a slow, solemn
footstep&mdash;only the echo of my own tread perhaps; but I shall never
know, for I shall be afraid to look round."</p>

<p>"You ought not to make sport of weak people's fancies, for I am sure
you don't believe in ghosts," said Allegra, leaning with one elbow on
the piano, turning over pieces of music absently, a graceful figure in
a dark green velvet gown, cut just low enough to show the fine curves
of a full, round throat, white and smooth as ivory.</p>

<p>"Not believe in ghosts? Did you ever know a sailor who wasn't
superstitious? We are too often alone with the sea and the stars to be
quite free from spectral fancies, Miss Leland. I can see in your eyes
as you look at me this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> moment that you believe in ghosts&mdash;believe and
tremble. Tell me now, candidly&mdash;When do you most fear them? At what
hour of the day or night does the unreal seem nearest to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she faltered, turning over the loose music with a
faintly tremulous gesture, while Isola sat by the piano, touching the
notes dumbly now and then.</p>

<p>"Is it at midnight&mdash;in the gloaming&mdash;in the chill, mysterious dawn?
You won't answer! Shall I guess? If you are like me, it is in broad
daylight&mdash;between two and three in the afternoon&mdash;when the servants
are all idling after their dinner, and the house is silent. You are
alone in a big, bright room, perhaps, with another room opening out of
it, and a door a long way off. You sit writing at your table, and you
feel all at once that the room is haunted&mdash;there must be something or
some one stealing in at that remotest door. You daren't look round.
You go to the window and look out into garden or street&mdash;for a town
house may be just as ghastly as a country one&mdash;and then with a great
effort you turn slowly round and face your terror, in the broad, garish
sunlight, in the business hours of the day. There is nothing there, of
course; but the feeling has not been the less vivid. I know I shall
be spectre-haunted at the Mount. You must all come and scare away the
shadows. Mr. Colfox, are you fond of billiards?"</p>

<p>"I own to a liking for the game. I play with Mr. Crowther and his
youngest daughter whenever I dine at Glenaveril. Alicia is a very fine
player, for a girl, and her father plays a good game."</p>

<p>"Then you will come up to the Mount two or three times a week and play
with me, I hope. There's a decent table&mdash;cushions as hard as bricks, I
dare say, but we must make the best of it&mdash;and there's plenty of sound
claret in the cellars to say nothing of a keg or two of Schiedam that I
sent home from the Hague."</p>

<p>"Mr. Colfox will not make much impression either on your claret or your
schnapps," said Disney, laughing. "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> is almost as temperate as one
of those terrible anchorites in the novel we were reading the other
day&mdash;'Homo Sum.'"</p>

<p>"I am glad you put in the qualifying 'almost,'" said the curate, "for I
hope to taste Captain Hulbert's Schiedam."</p>

<p>The captain expatiated upon what his three new friends&mdash;and his one old
friend, Martin Disney&mdash;were to do to cheer him in his solitude at the
Mount.</p>

<p>"There is nothing of the anchorite about me," he said. "I love society,
I love life and movement, I love bright faces."</p>

<p>He would not leave until they had all promised to take tea on board
the yacht on the following afternoon, an engagement which was kept by
Allegra and the colonel; but not by Isola, whose headache was worse
after the little dinner-party; nor by the curate, who had parish
business to detain him on shore.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></p>

<p class="center">"UNDER THE PINE-WOOD, BLIND WITH BOUGHS."</p>


<p>If Isola had any disinclination to visit Captain Hulbert's yacht,
her headache only served to defer the evil day, for after that
first tea-drinking came other invitations and other arrangements,
fishing-parties, luncheons off Mevagissey, entertainments in which
Isola must needs share when she saw her husband and his sister bent
upon the enjoyment of the hour, delighted with the <i>Vendetta</i> and her
warm-hearted skipper.</p>

<p>They were not John Hulbert's only friends in the neighbourhood.
Everybody seemed glad to welcome the rover to his native village.
Almost everybody had known him in his boyhood; and there was a general
consensus of opinion that he was a much better fellow than his brother.
He was less courted; but he was better liked. There had been a touch
of cynicism about Lostwithiel which frightened matter-of-fact country
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"One could never feel sure he wasn't laughing in his sleeve at our
rustic ignorance," said Mrs. Baynham. "I am more at my ease with
Captain Hulbert, and my husband and he were great friends when he was a
boy. They used to go fishing together, when Baynham's practice wasn't
as good as it is now."</p>

<p>So the brief Indian summer passed in pleasant idlesse on a tranquil
sea. The equinoctial gales had not begun to rage yet. There was a lull
before the coming of the great winds which were to blow good ships on
shore, and startle sleepers in the dead of night. All now was fair and
placid&mdash;sunlit waters, golden evenings. They spent one bright, balmy
day off Mevagissey, a day which was like a long dream to Isola, as she
sat on deck in a low folding-chair, wrapped in a great feathery rug
from the South Sea Islands, with her languid head reclining against
a plush-covered cushion, one of the many effeminate luxuries which
abounded in the cabins below. Everybody else was intent upon the nets.
Everybody else was full of interest and movement and expectation; but
she sat apart from all, with her ivory knitting-needles lying idle in
her lap, amidst a soft mass of white wool, which her industry was to
convert into a garment for the baby.</p>

<p>Allegra was enraptured with the yacht. She would fain have taken Isola
down to the cabins, to explore their wonders of luxury and contrivance,
so much comfort and elegance in so restricted an area; but Isola
refused to leave the deck.</p>

<p>"I hate all cabins," she said. "They are always suffocatingly hot."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Baynham went below with Allegra, and they two explored the two
principal cabins with wondering admiration, and even peeped into the
cook's galley, and the odd little places where steward and sailors
contrived to bestow themselves.</p>

<p>The chief cabin, saloon, or whatever one liked to call it, was as
daintily decorated as a lady's boudoir. There were nests of richly
bound books, Oriental bronzes, and all kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> of continental pottery,
Japanese and Indian embroideries, Venetian mirrors, quaint little
carved cupboards for wine or cigars. Every corner and cranny was
utilized.</p>

<p>"What a delicious drawing-room!" cried Allegra. "I could live here
all my life. Fancy, how delightful! A floating life. No such thing as
satiety. One might open one's eyes every morning on a fresh coast,
glorified, as one sees it across the bright, blue water. To explore the
Mediterranean, for instance, floating from city to city&mdash;the cities of
the past, the cities of the Gospel, the shores that were trodden by
the feet of St. Paul and his companions&mdash;the cities of the Christian
saints and martyrs, the island birthplaces of Greek gods and heroes.
Think, Mrs. Baynham! A yacht like this is a master-key to open all the
gateways of the world."</p>

<p>"I would rather have my own cosy little cottage on terra firma,"
answered the doctor's wife in a matter-of-fact mood; but this speech
of Allegra's set the good lady pondering upon the possibility of John
Hulbert falling in love with this nice, clever girl, and making her
mistress of his brother's yacht.</p>

<p>Her friendly fancy depicted the village wedding, and those two going
forth over the great waters to spend their honeymoon amidst the
wonder-world of the Mediterranean, which the banker's daughter knew
only in her Atlas.</p>

<p>"He can't be rich," she thought, "but he must have a comfortable
income. I know his mother had money. And Allegra can earn a good deal
by her painting. She wouldn't be an expensive wife. We ought all to do
our best to bring it about. A girl has so few chances in such a place
as Trelasco. She might almost as well be in a convent."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham was at heart a matchmaker, like most motherly women
whom fate has left childless. She was very fond of Allegra, who was
so much more companionable than Isola, so much more responsive to
kindness and affection. As she sat on deck in the westering sunlight,
somewhat comatose after a copious luncheon, Mrs. Baynham's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> idea of
helping Allegra took the form of a dinner-party which she had long been
meditating, her modest return for numerous dinners which she had eaten
at Glenaveril and at the Angler's Nest. She considered that three or
four times a year it behoved her to make a serious effort in the way
of hospitality&mdash;a substantial and elaborate dinner, in which no good
things in season should be spared, and which should be served with
all due ceremony. The time was at hand when such a dinner would in a
manner fall due; and she determined to hasten the date with a view to
Allegra's interests.</p>

<p>"Captain Hulbert is sure to be off again before long," she told
herself, "so every evening they can spend together is of importance.
I'm sure he is inclined to fall in love with her already."</p>

<p>There was not much doubt about his feelings as he stood by Allegra in
the stern, directing the movements of her bare active hands while she
hauled in the net; not much doubt that he was as deep in love as a
man well can be after a fortnight's acquaintance. He did not make any
secret of his bondage, but let his eyes tell all the world that this
girl was for him "the world's one woman."</p>

<p>The invitation from Mrs. Baynham was delivered by post next morning, as
ceremonious a card as if the place were Mayfair, and the inviter and
invitees had not met since last season. A copper-plate card, with name
and address filled in by the lady's pen, a detail which distinguished
her modest invitation from the Glenaveril cards, of which there were
a variety, for at homes, tennis, dinner, luncheon, to accept, and to
decline. A fortnight's notice marked the dignity of the occasion&mdash;the
hour the orthodox quarter to eight.</p>

<p>"We can't refuse, Isola," said Disney, when his wife handed him the
card, "although my past experience assures me that the evening will
be a trifle heavy. Why will people in small houses insist upon giving
dinner-parties, instead of having their friends in instalments? When we
go to dine with the Baynhams we go for love of them, not the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
they bring together; and yet they insist upon seating twelve in a room
that will just comfortably hold eight. It is all vanity and vexation of
spirit."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Baynham is so happy when she is giving a real dinner-party. I
don't think we can refuse, can we, Allegra?" asked Isola.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Baynham is a darling, and I wouldn't vex her for worlds," replied
her sister-in law. "And in a place like this one can't pretend a prior
engagement, unless it were in the moon."</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted forthwith, and when Captain Hulbert dropped
in at teatime it was discovered that he, too, had been asked, and that
he meant to accept, if his friends at the Angler's Nest were to be
there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A thunderbolt fell upon the little village on the following Sunday.
When the old men and women, creeping to church a little in advance
of younger legs, came to the church-path, they found the gate locked
against them, locked and barricaded with bars which looked as if they
were meant to last till the final cataclysm. The poor old creatures
looked up wonderingly at a newly-painted board, on which the more
intelligent among them spelt out the following legend&mdash;</p>

<p>"This wood is the private property of J. Vansittart Crowther, Esq.
Trespassers will be prosecuted."</p>

<p>Martin Disney and his wife and sister came up when a little crowd of
men, women, and children, numbering about thirty, had assembled round
the gate, all in their Sunday best.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" asked Disney.</p>

<p>"Ah, colonel, that's what we all want to know," replied old Manley, the
village carpenter, a bent and venerable figure, long past work. "I'm
over eighty, but I never remember that gate being locked as long as I
have lived at Trelasco, and that's all my life, colonel. There's always
been a right of way through that wood."</p>

<p>"And there always shall be," answered Martin Disney. "We won't take any
violent measures to-day, my friends&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>first because it is Sunday, and
next because one should always try fair means before one tries foul.
I shall write to Mr. Crowther to-morrow, asking him civilly to open
that gate. If he refuses, I'll have it opened for him, and I'll take
the consequences of the act. Now, my good friends, you'd better go to
church by the road. You'll get there after the service has begun. Wait
till the congregation are standing up, and then go into church all
together, so that everybody may understand why and by whose fault it is
that you are late."</p>

<p>The appearance of this large contingent after the first lesson created
considerable surprise, and much turning of heads and rustling of
bonnet-strings in the echoing old stone church. Mr. Crowther stood in
his pew of state on one side of the chancel, and felt that the war had
begun. Everybody was against him in the matter, he knew; but he wanted
to demonstrate the rich man's right to do what he liked with the things
which he had bought. The wood was his, and he did not mean to let the
whole parish tramp across it.</p>

<p>He received a stiffly polite letter from Colonel Disney, requesting him
to re-open the church-path without loss of time, and informing him of
the great inconvenience caused to the older and weaker members of the
congregation by the illegal closing of the path during church hours.</p>

<p>Mr. Crowther sent his reply by the colonel's messenger. He asserted
his right to shut up the wood which formed a part of his estate, and
positively refused to re-open the gate at either end of the footpath in
question.</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert dropped in at his usual hour, eager to know the
progress of the fight. Fight there must be, he was assured, having seen
something of Mr. Crowther's bulldog temper. Then, in the drawing-room
of the Angler's Nest, there was hatched a terrible plot&mdash;a Catiline
conspiracy in a tea-cup&mdash;Allegra listening and applauding while the two
men plotted.</p>

<p>That night, when the village was hushed in sleep, a boatful of sailors
landed at the little hard near the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> station at Fowey, and half
a dozen stalwart blue-jackets might have been seen tramping along
the old railway track to Trelasco, one carrying a crowbar, another
a carpenter's basket. And under the autumn stars that night in the
woods of Glenaveril, while Vansittart Crowther slept the sleep of the
just man who payeth his twenty shillings in the pound, there rose
the sound of a sea-song and the cheery chorus of the sailors, with a
rhythmic accompaniment of hammering; and lo, when the October morning
visited those yellowing woods, and when Mr. Crowther's gamekeeper went
on his morning round, the gate at either end of the church path was
wrenched off its hinges, and was lying on the ground. Staple and bolt,
padlock and iron hinges, were lying among the dewy dock-leaves and
the yellowing fern; and there was free passage between the village of
Trelasco and the House of God.</p>

<p>Vansittart Crowther went to Plymouth by the first train that could
convey him, and there consulted the lawyer most in renown among the
citizens; and that gentleman, after due thought and consideration,
informed him that the closing of such an old-established right of way
as that of the church-path was more than any landowner durst attempt.
Whatever omission there might be in the title-deeds, he had bought the
estate subject to that old right of way, which had been enjoyed by the
parish from time immemorial. He could no more shut it off than he could
wall out the sky.</p>

<p>"But I can punish the person who pulled the locks off my gates, I
conclude?" said Mr. Crowther, swelling with indignation.</p>

<p>"That, of course, is a distinct outrage, for which you may obtain
redress, if you can find out who did it."</p>

<p>"There can be no difficulty about that. The act must have been
instigated by the writer of that impertinent letter."</p>

<p>He pointed to Martin Disney's letter, lying open on the solicitor's
table.</p>

<p>"Very probably. But you will have to be sure of proving his share in
the act if you mean to take proceedings against him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Vansittart Crowther was furious. How was he to bring the responsibility
of this outrage home to anybody, when the deed had been done in the
dead of night, and no mortal eye had seen the depredators at their
felonious work? His locks and bolts and hinges, the best of their kind
that Sheffield could supply, had been mocked at and made as naught; and
all his dumb dogs of serving men and women had been lying in their too
comfortable beds, and had heard never a sound of hammer clinking or
crowbar striking on iron. There had not been so much as a kitchen-maid
afflicted with the tooth-ache, and lying wakeful, to hear the far-off
noise of that villainous deed.</p>

<p>Mr. Crowther sent for the police authorities of Fowey, and set his
wrongs before them.</p>

<p>"I will give fifty pounds reward to the man who will get me credible
evidence as to the person who planned that outrage," he said. And next
day there were bills pasted against divers doors at Fowey and Trelasco,
against the Mechanics' Institute, and against that curious old oaken
door of a mediæval building opposite the club, which may once have
been a donjon, and in sundry other conspicuous places, beginning with
"Whereas," and ending with Vansittart Crowther's signature.</p>

<p>Nothing came of this splendid offer, though there were plenty of
people in the district to whom fifty pounds would have seemed a
fortune. Whether no one had seen the crew of the <i>Vendetta</i> landing
or re-embarking in the night-time, or whether some wakeful eyes had
seen, whose owners would not betray the doers of a deed done in a good
cause, still remains unknown. Captain Hulbert was enchanted at the
success of the conspiracy, and went to church next Sunday by the now
notorious footpath, along which an unusual procession of villagers came
streaming in the crisp, clear air, proud to assert a right that had
been so boldly maintained by their unnamed but not unknown champion.
Every one felt very sure that the flinging open of the gates had been
somehow brought about by Martin Disney&mdash;Martin, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> grandfather they
could some of them remember, when he came home after the long war with
the French, and took up his abode in an old house among the hills, and
married a fair young wife. That had happened sixty-five years ago;
but there were those in the village who could remember handsome Major
Disney, with only one arm, and a face bronzed by the sun that shines on
the banks of the Douro.</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert went by the church-path that morning, although it took
him ever so far out of his way. He wanted to walk to church with the
Disney family, in order to talk over their victory; and the Disneys
seemed to-day to resolve themselves into one; and that one was Allegra
Leland; for she and the captain walked ahead and discoursed gaily,
perhaps in too exultant and worldly a vein for pious church people;
but at worst their exultation was in a good cause; for the horn of the
lowly was exalted, and the pride of the rich man was brought low.</p>

<p>"Do you think he will be at church?" asked Allegra, the pronoun
standing for Mr. Crowther.</p>

<p>"Of course he will. He must brazen out the position. He will be there,
no doubt, gnashing his teeth behind his prayer-book. If angry looks
could kill, you and I would be as dead as Ananias and Sapphira before
the end of the service."</p>

<p>"Poor, silly man, why did he want to shut up the footpath?" speculated
Allegra.</p>

<p>"Only to show his importance&mdash;to make himself felt in the
neighbourhood. They wouldn't have him for their representative, in
spite of his money, and his grand Church and State principles, and all
the Primrose Leaguing of his womankind; and so he turns savage and
wants to make himself disagreeable."</p>

<p>Yes, it was true that Mr. Crowther had stood for Lostwithiel on three
separate occasions, and with equal unsuccess on each. This may have
embittered him. If the anger of slighted beauty is a furious thing, no
less bitter is the sting of wounded vanity in the rejected candidate.</p>

<p>And then the parson and the doctor had told Mr. Crowther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> that he could
not close his wood against the public; an all-sufficient reason why he
should make the attempt.</p>

<p>The Crowther family were in the chancel pew in full force. Allegra
thought she detected signs of distress in Mrs. Crowther's countenance;
but the daughters went through the service with their noses in the air,
and were more than usually vivacious and conversational among their
friends between the church-porch and the landau which bore them away to
Glenaveril, and the sumptuous boredom of Sunday luncheon.</p>

<p>Merrily went the short autumn days on board the <i>Vendetta</i>, and merrily
went the tea-drinkings and talk in the drawing-room at the Angler's
Nest. Mrs. Disney did not often join the yachting expeditions east or
west. The sea made her head ache, she told them; but Mrs. Baynham, who
loved pleasure of any kind, was always ready to chaperon Allegra, and
Isola welcomed the wanderers to the cheery fireside and the friendly
five-o'clock tea. She spent her own days mostly in the society of her
baby, with whom she seemed to hold a kind of mysterious commune. She
had no idea of amusing him as the nurse had, none of those conventional
tricks and movements which are offered to generation after generation
of infants; but the child would lie in her lap for hours while she sang
to him in her low sweet voice the songs she had learnt in her early
girlhood&mdash;songs that the peasants of Brittany sing, some of them&mdash;and
others of a somewhat loftier strain. She would sing him little bits
of Mozart, those immortal melodies, of inexhaustible sweetness and
ineffable pathos, music mixed with smiles and tears, melody interwoven
with such melting tenderness as thrills the coldest heart. There was a
gentle happiness in these solitary hours which the young mother spent
with her child; and Martin Disney, coming into the room unawares,
sometimes stood for a minute or so in loving contemplation of that
domestic picture&mdash;the young fair face with its long oval form and
delicate features; the pensive gravity of the large violet eyes, and
mournful droop of the thin, flower-like lips. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> seen such a face
on canvas, the ideal Madonna of Raffaelle, with just that subdued
blonde colouring and pale auburn hair, and just that thoughtful
expression.</p>

<p>His heart swelled with gladness and gratitude as he contemplated mother
and son. Yes, the child had made all things well in his home.</p>

<p>Those aching doubts which he felt as he watched beside his wife's
sick-bed had vanished like clouds before the sun. Who could doubt the
happiness of the mother, absorbed in her firstborn? Who could doubt the
love of the wife, looking up at her husband with such tender welcome
as he bent over her shoulder to take the little curled-up fist in his,
unfold the crumpled fingers, and press them to his lips?</p>

<p>"You are very fond of him, Martin?" she asked, with an often repeated
inquiry, knowing what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"Fond of him! After you he is all that I have in this world&mdash;except
Allegra, who will float away into a world of her own by-and-by, and
belong to us no more."</p>

<p>"After me! He ought to be first, Martin&mdash;your son, your heir, your
second self in the days to come. He ought to have the first place in
your heart, Martin, for he is your future."</p>

<p>"No one is first but you."</p>

<p>He dropped the baby hand, and took his wife's head between his hands,
and lifted the fair young forehead, looking down at it fondly before he
stooped to kiss the soft clustering hair and pencilled brows and ivory
temples, with more than a lover's passion.</p>

<p class="center">"SAY THE FALSE CHARGE WAS TRUE."</p>


<p>The Baynhams' dinner-party was a function to be anticipated with
horror, and undergone with resignation. For the first week after the
acceptance of the invitation the ceremony had seemed so far off that
it could be talked about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> lightly, and even made an occasion for
mirth&mdash;Allegra giving her own little sketch of what a dinner at Myrtle
Lodge would be like&mdash;the drawing-room with its wealth of chair-backs
and photograph albums, and the water-colour landscapes which Mrs.
Baynham had painted while she was at a finishing school at Plymouth,
never having touched brush or pencil since&mdash;and Mrs. Baynham's
rosy-cheeked nieces from Truro, who always appeared on the scene of any
festivity. Yes, one could tell beforehand what the entertainment would
be like.</p>

<p>One thing they did not know, however, Mrs. Baynham having been
discreetly silent on the subject. They did not know that they were to
meet the Glenaveril family in full force, the doctor's wife being of
opinion that a friendly dinner-party was the panacea for all parish
quarrels and small antagonisms, and that by judiciously bringing the
Crowthers and the Disneys together at a well-spread board, and in the
genial atmosphere of her unspacious drawing-room, she could bring about
an end of the feud, or tacit coldness, which had divided the Angler's
Nest and Glenaveril since Colonel Disney's home-coming. It was a
disappointment to this worthy woman to see Vansittart Crowther, when
Colonel and Mrs. Disney were announced, start and glare as if a mad
dog had been brought into the room; but she was relieved at seeing the
easy nod which the colonel bestowed upon his vanquished foe, and the
friendly hand which good Mrs. Crowther held out to Isola, who paled and
blushed, and all but wept at meeting with that cordial matron.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you never come to see me," said Mrs. Crowther,
confidentially, having made room for Isola upon a very pretentious and
uncomfortable sofa of the cabriole period, a sofa with a sloping seat
and a stately back in three oval divisions, heavily framed in carved
walnut, a back against which it was agony to lean, a seat upon which it
was martyrdom to sit. "But I don't see why we shouldn't be friends when
we do happen to meet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Crowther, we are always friends. I shall never forget your
kindness to me."</p>

<p>"There, there; you're a tender-hearted soul, I know. It grieved me so
not to go and see you when you were ill; and not to pay attention to
your baby. Such a sweet little fellow, too. I've given him many a kiss
on the sly when I've met him and his nurse in the lanes. I suppose Mr.
Crowther and the colonel don't hitch their horses very well together.
That's at the bottom of it all, no doubt. But as for you and me, Isola,
I hope we shall always be good friends."</p>

<p>This confidential talk between the two women, observed by Mrs. Baynham
out of the corner of her eye, augured well; but Mr. Crowther had not
left off glaring, and a glare in those protruding eyeballs was awful.
He usurped the hearthrug, as he laid down the law about the political
situation and the impending ruin of the country.</p>

<p>"A feeble policy never maintained the prestige of any country, sir,"
he told Captain Pentreath, the half-pay bachelor, who was devoted
to fishing, and cared very little whether his country had prestige
or shuffled on without it&mdash;so long as fish would bite. "We lost our
prestige when we lost Beaconsfield, and with our prestige we are
losing our influence. The Continental powers leave us out of their
calculations. The neutral policy of the last ten years has stultified
the triumph of British arms from Marlborough to Wellington. The day
will come, sir, when the world will cease to believe in the history
of those magnificent campaigns. People will say, 'These are idle
traditions. England could never have been a warlike nation.'"</p>

<p>Captain Pentreath tried to look interested, but was obviously
indifferent to the opinion of future ages, and intent upon watching
Allegra, looking her handsomest in a yellow silk gown, and deep in talk
with Captain Hulbert, who leant his tall form against Mrs. Baynham's
cottage piano, which, with a view to artistic effect, had been
disguised in Algerian drapery, and wheeled into a position that made
the room more difficult of navigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>One only of the rosy-cheeked nieces was allowed to appear at the
dinner-table; firstly because the table was a tight fit for twelve, and
secondly because a thirteenth would have excited superstitious fears.
The younger sister, whom people asked about with tender solicitude,
was to be on view afterwards, when she would perform the bass to her
sister's treble in the famous overture to Zampa, which, although not
exactly a novelty, may be relied upon to open a musical evening with
<i>éclat</i>.</p>

<p>Every one bad arrived, and after a chilling delay, Potts, the local
fishmonger, who had been a butler, and who went out to wait at
dinner-parties, and was as familiar a figure as a saddle of mutton or
a cod's head and shoulders, made his solemn announcement, and with an
anxious mind, Mrs. Baynham saw her guests parade across the narrow hall
somewhat overfurnished with stags' heads, barometers, gig-whips and
umbrella-stands, to the dining-room, while a hot blast of roast meat
burst fiercely from the adjacent kitchen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham had allotted Isola to Mr. Crowther, determined to carry
out her idea of bringing about a friendly feeling. Mr. Baynham took
Mrs. Crowther, and Captain Pentreath had the privilege of escorting
Belinda, whose sentiments and airs and graces of every kind he knew by
heart. There was no more excitement in such companionship than in going
in to dinner with his grandmother. What is the use of being brought in
continual association with a handsome heiress if you know yourself a
detrimental?</p>

<p>"She would no more look at me as a lover than she would at a Pariah
dog," said the captain, when some officious boon companion at the club
suggested that he should enter himself for the Crowther Stakes.</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert was made happy with Allegra, and Colonel Disney was
honoured by his hostess, to whom strict etiquette would have prescribed
the peer's son. There was surplus female population in the persons of
Alicia Crowther and Mary Baynham, who agreeably adorned each side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the table with a little extra sweetness and light; Miss Baynham, buxom
and rosy in a white cashmere frock which she had grown out of since
her last dinner-party; Miss Crowther, square shouldered and bony, in a
black confection by Worth, with a bloated diamond heart making a mirage
upon a desert waste of chest, it being a point of honour with thin
girls to be more <i>décoletées</i> than their plumper sisters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham's conversation at one of her own dinners was apt to
be somewhat distracted and inconsecutive in substance, although
she maintained a smiling and delighted air all the time, whatever
anxieties might be wearing her spirit&mdash;anxieties about the cooking
and the attendance&mdash;angry wonder at the prolonged absence of the
parlour-maid&mdash;distress at seeing the lobster sauce dragging its slow
length along when people had nearly finished the turbot&mdash;agonizing
fears lest the <i>vol au vent</i> should not last out after that enormous
help taken by Captain Pentreath, in sheer absence of mind, perhaps,
since he only messed it about on his plate, while he bored Miss
Crowther with a prosy account of his latest victory over an obstinate
demon of the Jack family&mdash;"such a devil of a fellow, three feet long,
and with jaws like a crocodile."</p>

<p>Colonel Disney was almost as inconsecutive and fragmentary in his
conversation as his hostess, and did not imitate her smiling aspect.
He was silent and moody, as he had been at the Glenaveril dinner, more
than a year ago. That Silenus face bending towards his wife's ear&mdash;that
confidential air assumed in every look and tone&mdash;made him furious. He
could scarcely sit through the dinner. He wounded Mrs. Baynham in her
pride of heart as a housekeeper by hardly touching her choicest dishes.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Colonel Disney," she pleaded, "you must take one of my
lobster cromskys. I don't mind owning that I made them myself. It is an
<i>entrée</i> I learnt from the cook at my own home. My father was always
particular about his table, and we had a professed cook. Please don't
refuse a cromsky."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Disney took the thing on his plate, and sat frowning at it,
while a bustle at the door and a marked rise in the temperature
indicated the entrance of the <i>pièce de resistance</i>, in the shape of a
well-kept saddle of mutton.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you had seen the <i>Vendetta</i> before, hadn't you?" asked the
oily voice on the other side of the table. "You knew all about her.
Really, now, Mrs. Disney, was that your first visit to Lostwithiel's
yacht?"</p>

<p>Isola looked at the speaker as if he had struck her. Great God, how
pale she was! Or was it the reflection of the apple-green shade upon
the candle in front of her which gave her that ghastly look?</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I saw the yacht from the harbour years ago."</p>

<p>"But you were never on board her? How odd, now. I had a notion that
you must have seen that pretty cabin, and all Lostwithiel's finical
arrangements. He was so proud of the <i>Vendetta</i> when he was here. He
was always asking my girls on board. You remember, Alicia, how Lord
Lostwithiel used to ask you two girls to tea?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered his daughter, in her hard voice. "He asked us often
enough, but mother would not let us go."</p>

<p>"How very severe!" said Captain Hulbert, attracted by the sound of his
brother's name. "Why do you object to a tea-party on the <i>Vendetta</i>,
Mrs. Crowther? Have you a prejudice against yachts? Do you think they
are likely to go down in harbour, like the poor old <i>Royal George</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I am not afraid of that. Only I liked Lord Lostwithiel to come
to tea with us at Glenaveril; and I did not think it would be quite the
thing for my girls to visit a bachelor's yacht, even if I went with
them. People at Trelasco are only too ready to make unpleasant remarks.
They would have said we were running after Lord Lostwithiel."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it isn't the single girls who run after the men nowadays,"
said Mr. Crowther, with his Silenus grin; "it's the young married
women. They are the sirens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody took any notice of this remark; and the conversation which had
become general for a minute or two resumed its duologue form.</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert and Allegra went on with their animated discussion as
to the author of "Macbeth" and "Hamlet;" and Captain Pentreath took up
the thread of his story about the obstinate pike; Alicia talked to the
doctor about her last day with the hounds; and Mary Baynham told Mrs.
Crowther about a church bazaar, which had electrified Truro, and at
which she had "helped" at somebody else's stall.</p>

<p>"It was hard work standing about and trying to sell things all day, and
persuading stingy old gentlemen to put into raffles for talking dolls,"
said Miss Baynham. "I have pitied shop-girls ever since."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynham gave the signal for departure, feeling that her dinner,
from a material point of view, had been a success. The lobster sauce
had been backward, and the three last people to whom the <i>vol au vent</i>
was offered had got very little except pie-crust and white sauce,
but those were small blemishes. The mutton and the pheasants had
been unimpeachable; and on those substantial elements Mrs. Baynham
took her stand. She had spared neither pains nor money. Her Italian
cream was cream, and not cornflour. Her cabinet-pudding was a work of
art. She felt satisfied with herself, and knew that the doctor would
approve; and yet she felt somehow that the moral atmosphere had not
been altogether free from storm-cloud. Colonel Disney had looked on
at the feast with a gloomy countenance; Mr. Crowther had talked in an
unpleasant tone.</p>

<p>"I am afraid those two will never forget the church path," she thought,
as she set her nieces down to Zampa, and then went to inspect the
card-table in a snug corner near the fire, with its freshly lighted wax
candles, and new cards placed ready for the good old English game which
our ancestors called whist.</p>

<p>Zampa once started meant a noisy evening. Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> Pentreath would
sing "The Maid of Llangollen," and "Drink, puppy, drink." Mary Baynham
would murder "It was a dream," and scream the higher notes in "Ruby."
Duet would follow solo, and fantasia succeed ballad, Mrs. Baynham's
idea of a social gathering being the nearest attainable approach to
a penny reading. She would have had recitations, and imitations of
popular actors, had there been any one capable of providing that form
of amusement.</p>

<p>This evening, however, she failed in getting a quartette for whist.
Neither Mr. Crowther nor his wife was disposed for cards; Colonel
Disney coldly declined; and it was useless to ask the young people to
leave the attractions of that woody piano. While she was lamenting
this state of things, the whist-table being usually a feature in her
drawing-room, the Disneys and Allegra bade her good night, and were
gone before she had time to remonstrate with them for so early a
departure.</p>

<p>It seemed earlier than it really was, for the dinner had been late.
Disney's quick ear had heard the step of his favourite horse, punctual
as the church clock. He had ordered his carriage at half-past ten, and
at half-past ten he and his party left the drawing-room, the doctor
following to hand the ladies to their carriage, while the colonel
lighted a cigar on the door-step, preparatory to walking home.</p>

<p>"It's a fine night; I'd rather walk," he said.</p>

<p>He walked further than the Angler's Nest. He walked up to the hill
where he and Isola had sat in the summer sunshine on the day after
his home-coming. He roamed about that wild height for two hours, and
the church clock struck one while he was in the lane leading down to
Trelasco.</p>

<p>"If that man has any motive for his insolence&mdash;if there is any secret
between him and my wife, I'll wring the truth out of him before he is a
day older," the colonel said to himself, as he tramped homewards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>He wrote to Mr. Crowther next morning, requesting the favour of half
an hour's private conversation upon a very serious matter. He proposed
to call upon Mr. Crowther at twelve o'clock, if that hour would be
convenient. The bearer of the note would wait for an answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Crowther replied that he would be happy to see Colonel Disney at
the hour named.</p>

<p>Tho colonel arrived at Glenaveril with military punctuality, and
was forthwith shown into that grandiose apartment, where all those
time-honoured works which the respectable family bookseller considers
needful to the culture of the country gentleman were arranged in old
oak bookcases, newly carved out of soft chestnut wood in the workshops
of Venice. It was an imposing apartment, with panelled dado, gilded
Japanese paper, heavy cornice and ceiling, in <i>carton pierre</i>&mdash;such
a room as makes the joy of architect, builder, and furniture-maker.
So far as dignity and social position can be bought for money, those
attributes had been bought by Vansittart Crowther; and yet this
morning, standing before his mediæval fireplace, with his hands in the
pockets of his velvet lounge coat, he looked a craven. He advanced
a step or two to meet his visitor, and offered his hand, which the
colonel overlooked, fixing him at once with a gaze that went straight
to the heart of his mystery. He felt that an accuser was before
him&mdash;that he, Vansittart Crowther, was called to account.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crowther, I have come to ask what you mean by your insolent manner
to my wife?"</p>

<p>"Insolent! My dear Colonel Disney, I admire the lady in question more
than any other woman within twenty miles. Surely it is not insolent to
admire a pretty woman?"</p>

<p>"It is insolent to adopt the tone you have adopted to Mrs.
Disney&mdash;first in your own house&mdash;on the solitary occasion when my
wife and I were your guests&mdash;and next at the dinner-table last night.
I took no notice of your manner on the first occasion&mdash;for though I
considered your conduct offensive, I thought it might be your ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
manner to a pretty woman, and I considered I did enough in forbidding
my wife ever to re-enter your house. But last night the offence was
repeated&mdash;was grosser&mdash;and more distinctly marked. What do you mean by
talking to my wife of Lord Lostwithiel with a peculiar emphasis? What
do you mean by your affectation of a secret understanding with my wife
whenever you pronounce Lord Lostwithiel's name?"</p>

<p>"I am not aware that there has been anything peculiar in my
pronunciation of that name&mdash;or in my manner to Mrs. Disney," said Mr.
Crowther, looking at his boots, but with a malignant smile lurking at
the corners of his heavy lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are aware of both facts. You meant to be insolent, and
meant other people to notice your insolence. It was your way of being
even with me for defying you to shut up the wood yonder, and cut off
the people's favourite walk to church. You dared not attack me; but you
thought you could wreak your petty spite upon my wife&mdash;and you thought
I should be too dull to observe, or too much of a poltroon to resent
your impertinence. That's what you thought, Mr. Crowther: and I am here
to undeceive you, and to tell you that you are a coward and a liar, and
that if you don't like those words you may send any friend you please
to my friend, Captain Hulbert, to arrange a meeting in the nearest and
most convenient place on the other side of the channel."</p>

<p>Mr. Crowther turned very red, and then very pale. It was the first
time he had been invited to venture his life in defence of his honour;
and for the moment it seemed to him that honour was a small thing, a
shadowy possession exaggerated into importance by the out-at-elbows
and penniless among mankind, who had nothing else to boast of. As if a
man who always kept fifty thousand pounds at his bankers, and who had
money invested all over the world, would go and risk his life upon the
sands of Blankenburgh against a soldier whose retiring allowance was
something less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> three hundred a year, and who was perhaps a dead
shot. The idea was preposterous!</p>

<p>No, Mr. Crowther was not going to fight; and though he quailed before
those steady eyes of Martin Disney's, calm in their deep indignation,
this explanation was not unwelcome to him. He had a dagger ready to
plunge into his enemy's heart, and he did not mean to hold his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm not a fighting man, Colonel Disney," he said; "and if I were I
should hardly care to fight for a grass widow who made herself common
talk by her flirtation with a man of most notorious antecedents. We
will say that it never was any more than a flirtation&mdash;in spite of Mrs.
Disney's mysterious disappearance after the Hunt Ball, which happened
to correspond with Lord Lostwithiel's sudden departure. Tho two events
might have no connection&mdash;more especially as Mrs. Disney came back ten
days after, and Lord Lostwithiel hasn't come back yet."</p>

<p>"I can answer for my wife's conduct, sir, under all circumstances, and
amidst all surroundings. You are the first person who has ever dared
to cast a slur upon her, and it shall not be my fault if you are not
the last. I tell you again, to your face, that you are a coward and a
liar&mdash;a coward because you are insolent to a young and lovely woman,
and a liar because you insinuate evil against her which you are not
able to substantiate."</p>

<p>"Ask your wife where she was at the end of December, the year before
last&mdash;the year you were in India. Ask her what she had been doing in
London when she came back to Fowey on the last day of the year, and
travelled in the same train with my lawyer, Mr. MacAllister, who was
struck by her appearance, first because she was so pretty, and next
because she looked the picture of misery&mdash;got into conversation with
her, and found out who she was. If you think that is a lie you can go
to MacAllister, in the Old Jewry, and ask him to convince you that it
is a fact."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion. My wife has no secrets from me."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it. Then there is really nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> fight about
except a good deal of vulgar abuse on your part, which I am willing to
overlook. A man of your mature age, married to a beautiful girl, has
some excuse for being jealous."</p>

<p>"More excuse, perhaps, than a man of your age has for acting like a
cad," said the colonel, turning upon his heel, and leaving Mr. Crowther
to his reflections.</p>

<p>Those reflections were not altogether bitter. Mr. Crowther felt assured
that he had sown the seeds of future misery. He did not believe in the
colonel's assertion that there were no secrets between him and his
wife. He had cherished the knowledge of that mysterious journey from
London on the last day of the year. He had warned his confidential
friend and solicitor to mention the fact to no one else. He had pried
and questioned, and by various crooked ways had found out that Isola
had been absent from the Angler's Nest for some days after the Hunt
Ball, and he had told himself that she was a false wife, and that
Martin Disney was a fool to trust her.</p>

<p>As for being called by harsh names, he was too much a man of the world
to attach any importance to an angry husband's abuse. It made him not a
sixpence the poorer; and as there had been no witness to the interview
it scarcely diminished his dignity. The thing rested between him and
his enemy.</p>

<p>"He took down my gates, but I think I have given him something to think
about that will spoil his rest for many a night, before he has thought
it out," mused Mr. Crowther.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was after the usual luncheon hour before Martin Disney went back to
the Angler's Nest. He had been for a long walk by the river, trying
to walk down the devil that raged within him, before he could trust
himself to go home. His wife was alone in the drawing-room, sitting
by the fire with her baby in her lap; but this time he did not pause
on the threshold to contemplate that domestic picture. There was
no tenderness in the eyes which looked at his wife&mdash;only a stern
determination. Every feature in the familiar face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> looked strange and
rigid, as in the face of an accuser and judge.</p>

<p>"Send the child away, Isola. I want some serious talk with you."</p>

<p>She stretched out a faltering hand to the bell, looking at him,
pale and scared, but saying no word. She gave the baby to his nurse
presently in the same pallid dumbness, never taking her eyes from her
husband's face.</p>

<p>"Martin," she gasped at last, frozen by his angry gaze, "is there
anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is something horribly wrong&mdash;something that means
destruction. What were you doing in London the winter before last,
while I was away? What was the motive of your secret departure&mdash;your
stealthy return? What were you doing on the last day of the year? Where
had you been? With whom?"</p>

<p>She looked at him breathless with horror; whether at the accusation
implied in his words, or at his withering manner, it would have been
difficult for the looker-on to decide. His manner was terrible enough
to have scared any woman, as he stood before her, waiting for her
answer.</p>

<p>"Where had you been&mdash;with whom?" he repeated, while her lips
moved mutely, quivering as in abject fear. "Great God! why
can't you answer? Why do you look such a miserable, degraded
creature&mdash;self-convicted&mdash;not able to speak one word in your own
defence?"</p>

<p>"On the last day of the year?" she faltered, with those tremulous lips.</p>

<p>"On the last day of the year before last&mdash;the winter I spent in Burmah.
What were you doing&mdash;where were you&mdash;where had you been? Is it so
difficult to remember?"</p>

<p>"No, no; of course not," she cried, with a half-hysterical laugh. "You
frighten me out of my senses, Martin. I don't know what you are aiming
at. I was coming home from London on that day&mdash;of course&mdash;the 31st
of Jan&mdash;no, December. Coming home from Hans Place, where I had been
spending a few days with Gwendolen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"You never told me of that visit to Gwendolen."</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I'm sure I told you all about it in one of my letters. Perhaps
you did not get that letter&mdash;I remember you never noticed it in yours.
Martin, for God's sake, don't look at me like that!"</p>

<p>"I am looking at you to see if you are the woman I have loved and
believed in, or if you are as false as hell," he said, with his strong
hand grasping her shoulder, her face turned to his, so that those
frightened eyes of hers could not escape his scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Who has put this nonsense in your head?"</p>

<p>"Your neighbour&mdash;your good Mrs. Crowther's husband&mdash;told me that his
lawyer travelled with you from Paddington&mdash;on the 31st of December&mdash;the
year before last. He got into conversation with you&mdash;you remember,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No," she cried, with a sudden piteous change in her face, "I can't
remember."</p>

<p>"But you came from London on that day. You remember that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I came from Gwendolen's house on that day. I told you so in
my letter."</p>

<p>"That letter which I never received&mdash;telling me of that visit to which
you made no allusion in any of your later letters. It was about that
time, I think, that you fell off as a correspondent&mdash;left off telling
me all the little details of your life&mdash;which in your earlier letters
seemed to shorten the distance between us."</p>

<p>She was silent, listening to his reproaches with a sullen dumbness,
as it seemed to him, while he stood there in his agony of doubt&mdash;in
his despairing love. He turned from her with a heart-broken sigh, and
slowly left the room, going away he scarce knew whither, only to put
himself beyond the possibility of saying hard things to her, of letting
burning, branding words flash out of the devouring fire in his heart.</p>

<p>She stood for a few moments after he had gone, hesitating, breathless,
and frightened, like a hunted animal at bay&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>then ran to the door,
opened it softly, and listened. She could hear him pacing the room
above. Again she stood still and hesitated, her lips tightly set, her
hands clenched, her brow bent in painful thought. Then she snatched hat
and jacket from a corner of the hall where such things were kept, and
put them on hurriedly, with trembling hands, as if her fate depended
upon the speed with which she got herself ready to go out, looking up
at the great, dim, brazen face of the eight-day clock all the while.
And then she let herself out at a half-glass door into the garden, and
walked quickly to a side gate that opened in to the lane&mdash;the gate at
which the baker and the butcher stopped to gossip with the maids on
fine mornings.</p>

<p>There was a cold bracing wind, and the sun was declining in a sky
barred with dense black clouds&mdash;an ominous sky, prophetic of storm
or rain. Isola walked up the hill towards Tywardreath as if she were
going on an errand of deadliest moment, skirted and passed the village,
with no slackening of her pace, and so by hill and valley to Par, a
long and weary walk under ordinary circumstances for a delicate young
woman, although accustomed to long country walks. But Isola went upon
her lonely journey with a feverish determination which seemed to make
her unconscious of distance. Her steps never faltered upon the hard,
dusty road. The autumn wind that swept the dead leaves round her feet
seemed to hold her up and carry her along without effort upon her part.
Past copse and meadow, common land and stubble, she walked steadily
onward, looking neither to right nor left of her path, only straight
forward to the signal lights that showed fiery red in the grey dusk at
Par Junction. She watched the lights growing larger and more distinct
as she neared the end of her journey. She saw the fainter lights of the
village scattered thinly beyond the station lamps, low down towards the
sandy shore. She heard the distant rush of a train, and the dull sob
of the sea creeping up along the level shore, between the great cliffs
that screened the bay. A clock struck six as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> waited at the level
crossing, in an agony of impatience, while truck after truck of china
clay crept slowly by, in a procession that seemed endless; and then for
the first time she felt that the wind was cold, and that her thin serge
jacket did not protect her from that biting blast. Finally the line
was clear, and she was able to cross and make her way to the village
post-office.</p>

<p>Her business at the post-office occupied about a quarter of an hour,
and when she came out into the village street the sky had darkened,
and there were heavy rain-drops making black spots upon the grey dust
of the road; but she hurried back by the way she had come, recrossed
the line, and set out on the long journey home. The shower did not
last long, but it was not the only one she encountered on her way
back, and the poor little jacket was wet through when she re-entered
by the servant's gate, and by the half-glass door, creeping stealthily
into her own house and running upstairs to her own room to get rid of
her wet garments before any one could surprise her with questions and
sympathy. It was past eight o'clock, though she had walked so fast
all the way as to feel neither cold nor damp. She took off her wet
clothes and dressed herself for dinner in fear and trembling, imagining
that her absence would have been wondered at, and her errand would
be questioned. It was an infinite relief when she went down to the
drawing-room to find only Allegra sitting at her easel, working at a
sepia sketch by lamplight.</p>

<p>"Martin is very late," she said, looking up as Isola entered, "and he
is generally a model of punctuality. I hope there is nothing wrong.
Where have you been hiding yourself since lunch, Isa? Have you been
lying down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, part of the time"&mdash;hesitatingly. "It is very late."</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes to nine. Dale has been in twice in the last quarter of
an hour to say that the dinner is being spoilt. Hark! There's the door,
and Martin's step. Thank God, there is nothing wrong!" cried Allegra,
getting up and going out to meet her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Disney's countenance as he stood in the lamplight was not so
reassuring as the substantial fact of his return. It was something to
know that he was not dead, or hurt in any desperate way&mdash;victim of any
of those various accidents which the morbid mind of woman can imagine
if husband or kinsman be unusually late for dinner; but that things
were all right with him was open to question. He was ghastly pale, and
had a troubled, half-distracted expression which seared Allegra almost
as much as his prolonged absence had done.</p>

<p>"I am sure there is something wrong!" she said, when they were seated
at dinner, and the parlour-maid had withdrawn for a minute or two in
pursuance of her duties, having started them fairly with the fish.</p>

<p>"Oh no, there is nothing particularly amiss; I have been worried a
little, that's all. I am very sorry to be so unconscionably late for
dinner, and to sit down in this unkempt condition. But I loitered at
the club looking at the London papers. I shall have to go to London
to-morrow, Isola&mdash;on business&mdash;and I want you to go with me. Have you
any objection?"</p>

<p>She started at the word London, and looked at him curiously&mdash;surprised,
yet resolute&mdash;as if she were not altogether unprepared for some
startling proposition on his part.</p>

<p>"Of course not. I would rather go with you if you really have occasion
to go."</p>

<p>"I really have. It is very important. You won't mind our deserting you
for two or three days, will you, Allegra?" asked Disney, turning to
his sister. "Mrs. Baynham will be at your service as chaperon if you
want to go out anywhere while we are away. It is an office in which she
delights."</p>

<p>"I won't trouble her. I shall stay at home, and paint all the time.
I have a good deal of work to do to my pictures before they will be
ready for the winter exhibition, and the time for sending in is drawing
dreadfully near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> You need have no anxiety as to my gadding about,
Martin. You will find me shut up in my painting-room, come home when
you will."</p>

<p>Later, when she and her brother were alone in the drawing-room, she
went up to him softly and put her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>"Martin, dearest, I know you have some great trouble. Why don't you
tell me? Is it anything very bad? Does it mean loss of fortune; poverty
to be faced; this pretty home to be given up, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, my dear. The home is safe enough; the house will stand
firm as long as you and I live. I am not a shilling poorer than I was
yesterday. There is nothing the matter&mdash;nothing worth speaking about;
blue devils, vapours if you like. That's all."</p>

<p>"You are ill, Martin. You have found out that there is something wrong
with you&mdash;heart, lungs, something&mdash;and you are going to London to
consult a physician. Oh, my dear, dear brother," she cried, with a look
of agony, her arms still clasped about his neck, "don't keep me in the
dark; let me know the worst."</p>

<p>"There is no worst, Allegra. I am out of sorts, that's all. I am going
to town to see my lawyer."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></p>

<p class="center">"MY LIFE CONTINUES YOURS, AND YOUR LIFE MINE."</p>


<p>They started by the eleven-o'clock train from Fowey next morning,
husband and wife, in a strangely silent companionship&mdash;Isola very pale
and still as she sat in a corner of the railway carriage, with her back
to the rivers and the sea. Naturally, in a place of that kind, they
could not get away without being seen by some of their neighbours.
Captain Pentreath was going to Bodmin, and insisted upon throwing away
a half-finished cigar in order to enjoy the privilege of Colonel and
Mrs. Disney's society, being one of those un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>meditative animals who
hate solitude. He talked all the way to Par, lit a fresh cigar during
the wait at the junction, and reappeared just as the colonel and his
wife were taking their seats in the up-train.</p>

<p>"Have you room for me in there?" he asked, sacrificing more than
half of his second cigar. "I've got the <i>Mercury</i>&mdash;Jepps is in for
Stokumpton&mdash;a great triumph for our side."</p>

<p>He spread out the paper, and made believe to begin to read with a great
show of application, as if he meant to devour every syllable of Jepps's
long exposition of the political situation; but after two minutes he
dropped the <i>Mercury</i> on his knees and began to talk. There were people
in Fowey who doubted whether Captain Pentreath could read. He had been
able once, of course, or he could hardly have squeezed himself into the
Army; but there was an idea that he had forgotten the accomplishment,
except in its most elementary form upon sign-boards, and in the
headings of newspaper articles, printed large. It was supposed that the
intensity of effort by which he had taken in the cramming that enabled
him to pass the ordeal of the Examiners had left his brain a blank.</p>

<p>"You're not going further than Plymouth, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We are going to London."</p>

<p>"Are you really, now? A bad time of year for London&mdash;fogs and thaws,
and all kinds of beastly weather."</p>

<p>And then he asked a string of questions&mdash;futile, trivial, vexing as
summer flies buzzing round the head of an afternoon sleeper; and then
came the welcome cry of Bodmin Road, and he reluctantly left them.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey was passed almost in silence. They had the
compartment to themselves for the greater part of the time, and they
sat in opposite corners, pretending to read&mdash;Isola apparently absorbed
in a book that she had taken up at random just before she started, when
the carriage was at the door, and while Allegra was calling to her to
make haste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Carlyle's "Hero Worship." The big words, the magnificent
sentences, passed before her eyes like lines in an unknown language.
She had not the faintest idea what she was reading; but she followed
the lines and turned the leaf at the bottom of a page mechanically.</p>

<p>Martin Disney applied himself to the newspapers which he had
accumulated on the way&mdash;some at Par, some at Plymouth, some at Exeter,
till the compartment was littered all over with them. He turned and
tossed them about one after the other. Never had they seemed so
empty&mdash;the leaders such mere beating the air; the hard facts so few and
insignificant. He glanced at Isola as she sat in her corner, motionless
and composed. He watched the slender, white hands turning the leaves of
her book at regular intervals.</p>

<p>"Is your book very interesting?" he asked, at last, exasperated by her
calmness.</p>

<p>He had been attentive and polite to her, offering her the papers,
ordering tea for her at Exeter, doing all that a courteous husband
ought to do; but he had made no attempt at conversation&mdash;nor had she.
This question about the book was wrung from him by the intensity of his
irritation.</p>

<p>"It is a book you gave me years ago at Dinan," she answered, looking at
him piteously. "'Hero Worship.' Don't you remember? I had never read
anything of Carlyle's before then. You taught me to like him."</p>

<p>"Did I? Yes, I remember&mdash;a little Tauchnitz volume bound in
morocco&mdash;contraband in England. A cheat&mdash;like many things in this life."</p>

<p>He turned his face resolutely to the window, as if to end the
conversation, and he did not speak again till they were moving slowly
into the great station, in the azure brightness of the electric light.</p>

<p>"I have telegraphed for rooms at Whitley's," he said, naming a small
private hotel near Cavendish Square, where they had stayed for a few
days before he started for the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think it would be too late for us to call at Hans Place before
we go to our hotel?"</p>

<p>She started at the question. He saw her cheeks crimson in the lamplight.</p>

<p>"I don't think the lateness of hour will matter," she said, "unless
Gwendolen is dining out. She dines out very often."</p>

<p>"I hope to-night may be an exception."</p>

<p>"Do you want very much to see her?" asked Isola.</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"You are going to question her about me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Isola, that is what I am going to do."</p>

<p>"It is treating me rather like a criminal; or, at any rate, like a
person whose word cannot be believed."</p>

<p>"I can't help myself, Isola. Tho agony of doubt that I have gone
through can only be set at rest in one way. It is so strange a thing,
so impossible as it seems to me, that you should have visited your
sister while I was away, although no letter I received from you
contained the slightest allusion to that visit&mdash;an important event in
such a monotonous life as yours&mdash;and although no word you have ever
spoken since my return has touched upon it; till all at once, at a
moment's notice, when I tell you of your journey from London and the
slander to which it gave occasion&mdash;all at once you spring this visit
upon me, as if I ought to have known all about it."</p>

<p>"You can ask Gwendolen as many questions as you like," answered Isola,
with an offended air, "and you will see if she denies that I was with
her in the December you were away."</p>

<p>Colonel Disney handed his wife into a station brougham. The two
portmanteaux were put upon the roof, and the order was given&mdash;99, Hans
Place&mdash;for albeit Mr. Hazelrigg's splendid mansion was described on his
cards and his writing-paper as The Towers, it is always as well to have
a number for common people to know us by.</p>

<p>No word was spoken during the long drive from Paddington; no word
when the neat little brougham drew up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> front of a lofty flight of
steps leading up to a Heidelberg doorway, set in the midst of a florid
red-brick house, somewhat narrow in proportion to its height, and with
over much ornament in the way of terra cotta panelling, bay and oriel,
balcony and pediment.</p>

<p>A footman in dark green livery and rice powder opened the door. Mrs.
Hazelrigg was at home. He led the way to one of those dismal rooms
which are to be found in most fine houses&mdash;a room rarely used by the
family&mdash;a kind of pound for casual visitors. Sometimes the pound is
as cold and cheerless as a vestry in a new Anglican church; sometimes
it affects a learned air, lines its walls with books that no one ever
reads, and calls itself a library. Whatever form or phase it may take,
it never fails to chill the visitor.</p>

<p>There was naturally no fire in this apartment. Isola sank shivering
into a slippery leather chair, near the Early English fender; her
husband walked up and down the narrow floor space. This lasted for
nearly ten minutes, when Gwendolen came bursting in, a vision of
splendour, in a grey satin tea-gown, frothed with much foam of creamy
lace and pale pink ribbon, making a cascade of fluffiness from chin to
slippered toes.</p>

<p>"What a most astonishing thing!" she cried, after kissing Isola, and
holding out both her plump, white hands to the colonel. "Have you
dear, good people dropped from the clouds? I thought you were nearly
three hundred miles away when the man came to say you were waiting
to see me. It is a miracle we are dining at home to-night. We are so
seldom at home. Of course you will stay and dine with us. Come up to my
room and take off your hat, Isa. No, you needn't worry about dress,"
anticipating Disney's refusal; "we are quite alone. I am going to dine
in my tea-gown, and Daniel is only just home from the city."</p>

<p>"You are very kind; no, my dear Mrs. Hazelrigg, we won't dine with
you to-night," answered Disney. "We have only just come up to town.
We drove across the park to see you before going to our hotel. Our
portmanteaux are waiting at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> the door. We are in town for so short a
time that I wanted to see you at once&mdash;particularly as I have&mdash;a rather
foolish question to ask you."</p>

<p>His voice grew husky, though he tried his uttermost to maintain a
lightness of tone.</p>

<p>"Ask away," said Gwendolen, straightening herself in her glistening
grey gown, a splendid example of modern elegance in dress and
demeanour, and altogether a more brilliant and imposing beauty than the
pale, fragile figure sitting in a drooping attitude beside the fireless
hearth. "Ask away," repeated Gwendolen, gaily, glancing at her sister's
mournful face as she spoke. "If I can answer you I will&mdash;but please to
consider that I have a wretched memory."</p>

<p>"You are not likely to forget the fact I want to ascertain. My wife and
I have had an argument about dates&mdash;we are at variance about the date
of her last visit to you&mdash;while I was away&mdash;and I should like to settle
our little dispute, though it did not go so far as a wager. When was
she with you? On what date did she leave you?"</p>

<p>All hesitation and huskiness were gone from manner and voice. He stood
like a pillar, with his face turned towards his sister-in-law, his eyes
resolute and inquiring.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask me about dates," cried Gwendolen, "I never know dates.
I buy Letts in every form, year after year&mdash;but I never can keep up
my diary. Nothing but a self-acting diary would be of any use to me.
It was in December she came to me&mdash;and in December she left&mdash;after a
short visit. Come, Isa. You must remember the dates of your arrival and
departure, better than I. You don't live in the London whirl. You don't
have your brains addled by hearing about Buenos Ayres, Reading and
Philadelphias, Berthas, Brighton A's, and things."</p>

<p>Martin Disney looked at her searchingly. Her manner was perfectly easy
and natural, of a childlike transparency. Her large, bright, blue eyes
looked at him&mdash;fearless and candid as the eyes of a child.</p>

<p>"You ought to remember that it was on the last day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> the year I left
this house," said Isola, in her low, depressed voice, as of one weary
unto death. "You said enough about it at the time."</p>

<p>"Did I? Oh, I am such a feather-head, <i>tête de linotte</i>, as they used
to call me at Dinan. So it was&mdash;New Year's Eve&mdash;and I was vexed with
you for not staying to see the New Year in. That was it. I remember
everything about it now."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Hazelrigg," said Martin Disney, and then going over to
his wife, he said gravely, "Forgive me, Isola, I was wrong."</p>

<p>He held out his hands to her with a pleading look, and she rose slowly
from her chair, and let her head fall upon his breast as he put his
arms round her, soothing and caressing her.</p>

<p>"My poor girl, I was wrong&mdash;wrong&mdash;wrong&mdash;a sinner against your truth
and purity," he murmured low in her ear; and then he added laughingly,
to Gwendolen, "Were we not fools to dispute about such a trifle?"</p>

<p>"All married people are fools on occasion," answered Mrs. Hazelrigg. "I
have often quarrelled desperately with Daniel about a mere nothing&mdash;not
because he was wrong, but because I wanted to quarrel. That kind of
thing clears the air&mdash;like a thunderstorm. One feels so dutiful and
affectionate afterwards. Dan gave me this sapphire ring after one of
our biggest rows," she added, holding up a sparkling finger.</p>

<p>Daniel Hazelrigg came into the room while she was talking of him, a
large man, with a bald head and sandy beard, a genial-looking man,
pleased with a world in which he had been permitted always to foresee
the rise and fall of stocks. The Hazelriggs were the very type of
a comfortable couple, so steeped in prosperity and the good things
of this world as to be hardly aware of any keener air outside the
gardenia-scented atmosphere of their own house; hardly aware of men who
dined badly or women who made their own gowns; much less of men who
never dined at all, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> women who flung themselves despairing from the
parapets of the London bridges.</p>

<p>Mr. Hazelrigg came into the room beaming, looked at his wife and
smiled, as he held out his hand to Colonel Disney, looked at his
sister-in-law and smiled again, and held out his hand to her, the smile
broadening a little, as if with really affectionate interest.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you, my dear Mrs. Disney; but I can't compliment
you upon looking as well as you did when we last met."</p>

<p>"She is tired after her long journey," said Gwendolen, quickly. "That's
all there is amiss."</p>

<p>"The sooner we get to our hotel the better for both of us," said
Disney. "We are dusty and weather-beaten, and altogether bad company.
Good night, Mrs. Hazelrigg."</p>

<p>"But surely you'll stop and dine; it's close upon eight," remonstrated
Hazelrigg, who was the essence of hospitality. "You can send on your
luggage, and go to your hotel later."</p>

<p>"You are very good, but we are not fit for dining out. Isola looks half
dead with fatigue," answered Disney. "Once more, good night."</p>

<p>He shook hands with husband and wife and hurried Isola to the door.</p>

<p>"Be sure you come to me the first thing to-morrow," said Gwendolen
to her sister. "I shall stay in till you come, and I can drive
you anywhere you want to go for your shopping&mdash;Stores, Lewis and
Allanby's&mdash;anywhere. I want to show you my drawing-room. I have changed
everything in it. You'll hardly know it again."</p>

<p>She and her husband followed the departing guests to the hall, saw
them get into the little brougham and drive off into the night; and
then Gwendolen put her arm through her husband's with a soft clinging
affectionateness, as of a Persian cat, that knew when it was well
housed and taken good care of.</p>

<p>"Poor Isa! how awfully ill she looks," sighed Gwendolen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ghastly. Are all women alike, I wonder, Gwen?"</p>

<p>"I think you ought to know what kind of woman I am by this time,"
retorted his wife, tossing up her head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Martin Disney and his wife were alone in their sitting-room at the
hotel, somewhat bare and unhomelike, as hotel rooms must always
be, despite the march of civilization which has introduced certain
improvements. He had made a pretence of dining in the coffee-room
below, and she had taken some tea and toast beside the fire; and now at
ten o'clock they were sitting on each side of the hearth, face to face,
pale and thoughtful, and strangely silent.</p>

<p>"Isola, have you forgiven me?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"With all my heart. Oh, Martin, I could never be angry with you&mdash;never.
You have been so good to me. How could I be angry?"</p>

<p>"But you have the right to be angry. I ought not to have doubted. I
ought to have believed your word against all the world; but that man
raised a doubting devil in me. I was mad with fears and suspicions,
wild and unreasonable&mdash;as I suppose jealousy generally is. I had never
been jealous before. Great God! what a fearful passion it is when a
man gives himself up to it. I frightened you by my vehemence, and then
your scared looks frightened me. I mistook fear for guilt. Isola, my
beloved, let me hear the truth from your own lips&mdash;the assurance&mdash;the
certainty," he cried with impassioned fervour, getting up and going
over to her, looking down into the pale, upturned face with those dark,
earnest eyes which always seemed to search the mysteries of her heart.
"Let there be no shadow of uncertainty or distrust between us. I have
heard from your sister that you were with her when you said you were.
That is much. It settles for that vile cad's insinuated slander; but it
is not enough. Let the assurance come to me from your lips&mdash;from yours
alone. Tell me&mdash;by the God who will judge us both some day&mdash;Are you my
own true wife?"</p>

<p>"I am, Martin&mdash;I am your own true wife," she answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> with an
earnestness that thrilled him. "I have not a thought that is not of
you. I love you with all my heart and mind. Is not that enough?"</p>

<p>"And you have never wronged me? You have been true and pure always? I
call upon God to hear your words, Isola. Is that true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; it is true."</p>

<p>"God bless you, darling! I will never speak of doubt again. You are
my own sweet wife, and shall be honoured and trusted to the end of my
days. Thank God, the cloud is past, and we can be happy again!"</p>

<p>She rose from her low seat by the fire, and put her arms round his
neck, and hid her face upon his breast, sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>"My own dear girl, I have been cruel to you&mdash;brutal and unkind; but
you would forgive me if you knew what I have suffered since noon
yesterday; and, indeed, my suffering began before then. That man's
harping on Lostwithiel's name in all his talk with you&mdash;his air of
meaning more than he said&mdash;and your embarrassment, awakened suspicions
that had to be set at rest somehow. Remember the disadvantages under
which I labour&mdash;the difference in our ages; my unattractiveness as
compared with younger men. These things predisposed me to doubt your
love. I have not had a moment's peace since the night of that odious
dinner-party. Yes; I have felt a new sensation. I know what jealousy
means. But it is past. Praise be to God, it is past. I have come out of
the cloud again. Oh, my love, had it been otherwise! Had we been doomed
to part!"</p>

<p>"What would you have done, Martin?" she asked, in a low voice, with her
face still hidden against his breast, his arms still round her.</p>

<p>"What would I have done, love? Nothing to bring shame on you. Nothing
to add to your dishonour or sharpen the agony of remorse. I should have
taken my son&mdash;my son could not be left under the shadow of a mother's
shame. He and I would have vanished out of your life. You would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> have
heard no more of us. The world would have known nothing. You would have
been cared for and protected from further evil&mdash;protected from your own
frailty. So far, I would have done my duty as your husband to the last
day of my life; but you and I would never have looked upon each other
again."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel Disney and his wife stayed in London two days; perhaps to give
a colour to their sudden and in somewise unexplained journey; but Isola
refused all her sister's invitations, to lunch, to drive, to dine,
to go to an afternoon concert at the Albert Hall, or to see the last
Shakespearean revival at the Lyceum. She pleaded various excuses; and
Gwendolen had to be satisfied with one visit, at afternoon teatime,
when husband and wife appeared together, on the eve of their return to
Cornwall.</p>

<p>"It was too bad of you not to come to me yesterday morning, as you
promised," Gwendolen said to her sister. "I stayed indoors till after
luncheon on your account; and the days are so short at this time of
year. I couldn't do any shopping."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hazelrigg was one of those young women for whom life is
flavourless when they have nothing to buy. She was so well supplied
with everything that women desire or care for that she had to invent
wants for herself. She had to watch the advertisements in order to
tempt herself with some new wish; were it only for a patent toast-rack,
or a new design in ivory paper-knives. The stationers helped to
keep life in her by their new departures in writing-paper. Papyrus,
Mandarin, Telegraphic, Good Form, Casual, mauve, orange, scarlet,
verdigris green. So long as the thing was new it made an excuse for
sitting in front of a counter and turning over the contents of a
show-case.</p>

<p>"You never came to look at my drawing-room by daylight," she went on
complainingly. "You can't possibly judge the tints by lamplight. Every
chair is of a different shade. I think you have treated me shamefully.
I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> sent you more telegrams than I could count. And I had such lots
to talk about. Have you heard from Dinan lately?"</p>

<p>"Not since August, when mother wrote in answer to our invitation for
her and father to spend a month with us. I felt it was hopeless when I
wrote to her."</p>

<p>"Utterly hopeless! Nothing will tempt her to cross the sea. She writes
about it as if it were the Atlantic. And Lucy Folkestone tells me she
is getting stouter."</p>

<p>"You mean mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, naturally. There's no fear of Lucy ever being anything but bones.
Mother is stouter and more sedentary than ever, Lucy says. It's really
dreadful. One doesn't know where it will end," added Gwendolen, looking
down at her own somewhat portly figure, as if fearing hereditary evil.</p>

<p>"I shall have to take Isa and the boy to Dinan next summer," said
Disney. "It is no use asking the father and mother to cross the
channel; though I think they would both like to see their grandson."</p>

<p>"Mother raved about him in her last letter to me," replied Gwendolen.
"She was quite overcome by the photograph you sent her, only she has
got into such a groove&mdash;her knitting, her novel, her little walk on
the terrace, her long consultations with Toinette about the smallest
domestic details&mdash;whether the mattresses shall be unpicked to-day or
to-morrow, or whether the <i>lessive</i> shall be a week earlier or a week
later. It is dreadful to think of such a life," added Gwendolen, as if
her own existence were one of loftiest aims.</p>

<p class="center">"SORROW THAT'S DEEPER THAN WE DREAM, PERCHANCE."</p>


<p>Life flowed on its monotonous course, like the Fowey river gliding down
from Lostwithiel to the sea; and there seemed nothing in this world
that could again disturb Martin Disney's domestic peace. Vansittart
Crowther made no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> further attempt to avenge himself for the night
attack upon his gates; nor did he demand any apology for the vulgar
abuse which he had suffered in the sanctuary of his own library. This
he endured, and even further outrage, in the shape of the following
letter from Colonel Disney:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"As you have been pleased to take a certain old-womanish interest
in my domestic affairs, I think it may be as well to satisfy your
curiosity so far as to inform you that when your solicitor travelled
in the same train with my wife, she was returning from a visit to her
married sister's house, a visit which had my sanction and approval.
I can only regret that her husband's modest means constrained her to
travel alone, and subjected her to the impertinent attentions of one
cad and to the slanderous aspersions of another.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 10%;">"I have the honour to be,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 20%;">"Yours, etc.,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 30%;">"<span class="smcap">Martin Disney</span>."</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Crowther treated this letter with the silent contempt which he told
himself it merited. What could he say to a man so possessed by uxorious
hallucinations, so steeped in the poppy and mandragora of a blind
affection, that reason had lost all power over his mind.</p>

<p>"I spoke plain enough&mdash;as plain as I dared," said Mr. Crowther. "He
may ride the high horse and bluster as much as he likes. I don't think
he'll ever feel quite happy again."</p>

<p>Yet in spite of hints and insinuations from the enemy at his gates,
Martin Disney was happy&mdash;utterly happy in the love of his young wife,
and in the growing graces of his infant son. He no longer doubted
Isola's affection. Her tender regard for him showed itself in every act
of her life; in every look of the watchful face that was always on the
alert to divine his pleasure, to forestall his wishes. Mrs. Baynham
went about everywhere expatiating on the domestic happiness of the
Disney family, to whom she was more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> ever devoted, now that she
felt herself in a manner related to them, having been elevated to the
position of godmother to the firstborn&mdash;a very different thing to being
godmother to some sixth or seventh link in the family-chain, when all
thought of selection has been abandoned, and the only question mooted
by the parents has been, "What good-natured friend <i>can</i> we ask this
time?"</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert took his yacht to other waters in November, only to
come sailing back again in December, when he finally laid up the
<i>Vendetta</i> in winter quarters, and took up his abode at the Mount,
where he availed himself of his brother's stud, which had been reduced
to two old hunters and a pair of carriage-horses of mediocre quality.
And so the shortening days drew on towards Christmas; baby's first
Christmas, as that small person's adorers remarked&mdash;as if it were
a wonderful thing for any young Christian to make a beginning of
life&mdash;and all was happiness at the Angler's Nest. All was happiness
without a cloud, till one morning&mdash;Allegra and her brother being alone
in the library, where she sometimes painted at her little table-easel,
while he read&mdash;she put down her palette and went over to him, laying
her hand upon his shoulder as he sat in his accustomed place in the
old-fashioned bow-window.</p>

<p>"Martin, I want to speak to you about Isola," she said, rather
tremulously.</p>

<p>"What about her? Why, she was here this minute," he exclaimed. "Is
there anything amiss?"</p>

<p>"I do not think she is so strong as she ought to be. You may not
notice, perhaps. A woman is quicker to see these things than a
man&mdash;and she and I used to walk and row together&mdash;I am able to see the
difference in her since last year. She seems to me to have been going
back in her health for the last month or two, since her wonderful
recovery from her illness. Don't be anxious, Martin!" she said,
answering his agonized look. "I feel sure there is nothing that a
little care cannot cure; but I want to put you on your guard. I asked
her to let me send for Mr. Baynham, and she refused."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, he sees her two or three times a week&mdash;he is in and out like one
of ourselves."</p>

<p>"But he doesn't see her professionally. He comes in hurriedly late in
the evening&mdash;or between the lights&mdash;to fetch his wife. He is tired, and
we all talk to him, and Isa is bright and lively. He is not likely to
notice the change in her in that casual way."</p>

<p>"Is there a change?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure there is. Although I see her every day, I am conscious
of the change."</p>

<p>"Baynham shall talk to her this afternoon."</p>

<p>"That's right, Martin&mdash;and if I were you I'd have the doctor from
Plymouth again."</p>

<p>Life had been so full of bliss lately, and yet he had not been afraid.
Yes, it was the old story. "Metuit secundis." That is what the wise man
does. Fools do otherwise&mdash;hug themselves in their short-lived gladness,
and say in their hearts, "There is no death."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Baynham came in the afternoon, in answer to a little note from
Martin Disney, and he and Isola were closeted together in the library
for some time, with baby's nurse in attendance to assist her mistress
in preparing for the ordeal by stethoscope. Happily that little
instrument which thrills us all with the aching pain of fear when we
see it in the doctor's hand, told no evil tidings of Isola's lungs or
heart. Thero was nothing organically wrong&mdash;but the patient was in a
very weak state.</p>

<p>"You really are uncommonly low," said Mr. Baynham, looking at her
intently as she stood before him in the wintry sunlight. "I don't know
what you've been doing to yourself to bring yourself down so much since
last summer&mdash;after all the trouble I took to build you up, too. I'm
afraid you've been worrying yourself about the youngster&mdash;a regular
young Hercules. I don't know whether he'd be up to strangling a pair of
prize pythons; but I'm sure he could strangle you. I shall send you a
tonic; and you'll have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> take a good deal more care of yourself than
you seem to have been taking lately."</p>

<p>And then he laid down severe rules as to diet, until it seemed to Isola
that he wished her to be eating and drinking all day&mdash;new-laid eggs,
cream, old port, beef-tea&mdash;all the things which she had loathed in the
dreary days of her long illness.</p>

<p>Mr. Baynham had a serious talk with the colonel after he left Isola,
and it was agreed between them that she should be taken to Plymouth
next day to see the great authority.</p>

<p>"You are giving yourself a great deal too much trouble about me,
Martin," she said. "There is nothing wrong. I am only a little weak and
tired sometimes."</p>

<p>Her husband looked at her heart-brokenly. Weak and tired. Yes; there
were all the signs of failing life in those languid movements of
the long, slender limbs, in the transparent pallor of the ethereal
countenance. Decay was lovely in this fair young form; but he felt
that it was decay. There must be something done to stop Misfortune's
hastening feet.</p>

<p>He questioned his wife, he questioned his own memory, as to when the
change had begun, and on looking back thus thoughtfully it seemed to
him that her spirits and her strength had flagged from the time of
Captain Hulbert's arrival at Fowey. She had seemed tolerably cheerful
until then, interested in life, ready to participate in any amusement
or occupation of Allegra's; but from the beginning of their yachting
excursions there had been a change. She had shrunk from any share in
their plans or expeditions. She had gone on board the yacht&mdash;on the
two or three occasions when she had been persuaded to go&mdash;with obvious
reluctance, and she had been silent and joyless all the time she was
there. Within the last fortnight, when Captain Hulbert had pressed her
to go to luncheon or afternoon tea at the Mount, she had persistently
refused. She had begged her husband to take Allegra, and to excuse her.</p>

<p>"The walk up the hill would tire me," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"My love, why should we walk? I will drive you there, of course."</p>

<p>"I really had rather not go. I can't bear leaving baby so long; and
there is no necessity for me to be with you. Allegra is the person
who is wanted. You must understand that, Martin. You can see how much
Captain Hulbert admires her."</p>

<p>"And I am to go and play propriety while you do baby-worship at home.
Rather hard upon me."</p>

<p>This kind of thing had occurred three or four times since the
sailor's establishment at the Mount, and Colonel Disney had attached
no significance to the matter; but now that he had begun to torture
himself by unending speculations upon the cause of her declining
health, he could but think that Captain Hulbert's society had been
distasteful to her. It might be that Mr. Crowther's insulting allusions
to Lord Lostwithiel had made any association with that name painful;
and yet this would seem an overstrained sensitiveness, since her own
innocence of all evil should have made her indifferent to a vulgarian's
covert sneers.</p>

<p class="center">"THE YEAR OF THE ROSE IS BRIEF."</p>


<p>Mr. Baynham accompanied his patient and her husband to Plymouth,
where the family adviser of Trelasco had a long and serious talk with
the leading medical light of the great seaport. The result of which
consultation&mdash;after the tossing to and fro of such words as anæmia,
atrophy, family history, hysteria, between the two doctors, as lightly
as if diseases were shuttle-cocks&mdash;was briefly communicated to Colonel
Disney in a sentence that struck terror to his heart, carefully as it
was couched. It amounted in plain words to this: We think your wife's
condition serious enough to cause alarm, although there are at present
no indications of organic disease. Should her state of bodily weakness
and mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> depression continue, we apprehend atrophy, or perhaps
chronic hysteria. Under these circumstances, we strongly recommend you
to give her a change of scene, and a milder winter climate even than
that of the west of England. Were she living in Scotland or Yorkshire
we might send her to Penzance; but as it is we should advise either a
sea voyage, or a residence for the rest of the winter at Pau, Biarritz,
or on the Riviera.</p>

<p>Modern medicine has a high-handed way of sending patients to the
uttermost ends of the earth; and although Martin Disney thought with
a regretful pang of the house and stables that he had built and
beautified for himself, the garden where every shrub was dear, yet he
felt grateful to the specialist for not ordering him to take his wife
to the banks of the Amazon or to some sheltered valley in Cashmere.
Pau is not far&mdash;the Riviera is the beaten track of civilized Europe,
the highway road to Naples and the East. He thought of the happy
honeymoon, when he and his bright young wife had travelled along that
garden of oranges and lemons, between the hills and the sea, and how
there had been no shadow on their lives except the shadow of impending
separation, about which they had talked hopefully, trying to believe
that a year or two would not seem very long, trying to project their
thoughts into that happy future when there should be no more parting.</p>

<p>This&mdash;this dreary present&mdash;was that future which they had pictured as a
period of unalloyed bliss. What had the future brought to that hopeful
husband, going forth at the call of duty, to return with fondest
expectations when his work was done? What but a year and a half of
wedded life overshadowed by disappointment, darkened by vague doubts?
And now came the fear of a longer parting than had lain at the end of
his last Italian journey.</p>

<p>The patient herself was told nothing except that change to a warmer
climate would be good for her, and that her husband had promised to
take her to the South soon after Christmas.</p>

<p>"You will like to go, won't you, Isola?" he asked her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> tenderly, as
they drove back to the station alone, leaving Mr. Baynham to follow
his own devices in the town. "You will enjoy seeing the places we saw
together when our marriage was still a new thing?"</p>

<p>"I shall like to go anywhere with you, Martin," she answered. "But is
it really necessary to go away? I know you love Trelasco."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have the Cornishman's passion for his native soil; but I am not
so rooted to it as to pine in exile. I shall be happy enough in the
South, with my dear young wife; especially if I see the roses come back
to your cheeks in that land of flowers."</p>

<p>"But it will cost you such a lot of money to take us all away, Martin;
and you could not leave Allegra or the baby. Doctors have such
expensive ideas."</p>

<p>"Allegra, and the boy! Must we take them, do you think, love?"</p>

<p>"We could not leave him," said Isola, horrified at the bare suggestion;
"and it would be very hard to leave Allegra. She bore all the burden of
my illness. She has been so good and unselfish. And she will so revel
in the South. She has never travelled, she, for whom Nature means so
much more than it can for you or me."</p>

<p>"Well, we will take Allegra, and the boy, whose railway ticket will
cost nothing, and his nurse. There is a shot in the locker still, Isa,
in spite of last year's building operations, which cost a good deal
more than I expected. We will all migrate together. Consider that
settled. The only question that remains is the direction in which we
shall go. Shall we make for the Pyrenees or the Maritime Alps? Shall we
go to Pau, and Biarritz, or to the Riviera, Hyères, Cannes, Nice?"</p>

<p>Isola was in favour of Pau, but after much consultation of books
recording other people's experiences, it was finally decided that of
all places in the world, San Remo was the best winter home for Martin
Disney's wife.</p>

<p>"You can take her up to the Engadine in June," said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> Baynham,
who had a superficial familiarity with the Continent from hearing
his patients talk about their travels, he himself never having left
Cornwall, except for a plunge into the metropolitan vortex during the
Cattle Show week. "Or you may spend your summer in Auvergne&mdash;unless you
want to come home as soon as the cold weather is over."</p>

<p>"I shall do whatever may be best for her&mdash;home or otherwise," answered
Disney. "You may be sure of that."</p>

<p>Tho doctor went back to his wife, with whom he always discussed
everything, except purely professional matters&mdash;there were even
occasions when he could not refrain from enlarging upon the interesting
features of some very pretty case&mdash;and was enthusiastic in his praise
of Colonel Disney.</p>

<p>"I never saw such devotion," he said. "Any other man would think it
hard lines to have to strike his tent at a day's notice, and go off to
winter at a strange place, among invalids and old women; but Disney
says never a word of his own inclinations or his own inconvenience. He
positively adores that young woman. I only hope she's worth it."</p>

<p>"She's very fond of him, Tom," replied Mrs. Baynham, decisively. "There
was a time when I was rather doubtful about that. She seemed listless
and indifferent. But since the baby came she has been growing fonder
and fonder of her husband. I flatter myself I am a pretty good judge of
countenances, and I can read hers. I've seen her face light up when the
colonel came into the room. I've seen her go over to him shyly, as if
it were still their honeymoon. She's a very sweet creature. I took to
her from the first; and I shall be dreadfully upset if she goes into a
decline."</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head despondently.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to fight with in her case," he said, "and there's very
little to fall back upon. I can't make her out. She has gone off just
like a girl who was simply fretting herself to death; and yet, if she's
fond of her husband, what in Heaven's name is there for her to fret
about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered his wife. "It's just a delicate constitution,
that's all. She's like one of those grape hyacinths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> that never will
stand upright in a vase. The stem isn't strong enough."</p>

<p>Allegra was all sympathy and affection. She would go with them&mdash;yes, to
the end of the world. To go to San Remo would be delightful.</p>

<p>"It is a deliciously paintable place, I know," she said, "for I have
seen bits of the scenery often enough in the exhibitions. I shall work
prodigiously, and earn a small fortune."</p>

<p>She told her brother in the most delicate way that she meant to pay her
own expenses in this Italian tour; for of course when Isola should be
strong enough they would go about a little, and see the Wonderland of
Italy.</p>

<p>Martin protested warmly against any such arrangement.</p>

<p>"Then I shall not go," she exclaimed. "Do you think me one of the
incapable young women of the old school&mdash;unable to earn a sixpence, and
wanting to be paid for and taken care of like a child? I would have you
to know, sir, that I am one of the young women of the new school, who
travel third-class, ride on the tops of omnibuses, and earn their own
living."</p>

<p>"But I shall take a house at San Remo, Allegra. Do you expect me to
turn innkeeper&mdash;charge you for your bed and board?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are monstrously proud. You can do as you like in your own
house, I suppose. But all travelling and hotel expenses will be my
affair, remember that."</p>

<p>"And you don't mind leaving Trelasco?"</p>

<p>"I am like Ruth. You are my home and my country. Where thou goest I
will go."</p>

<p>"And Captain Hulbert&mdash;how will he like to lose you?"</p>

<p>"What am I to Captain Hulbert?" she asked, trying to laugh off the
question, but blushing deeply as she bent over her colour-box, suddenly
interested in the littered contents.</p>

<p>"A great deal, I fancy, though he may not have found plain speech for
his feelings yet awhile."</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if you are not a very foolish person, and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> any foundation
for your absurd idea, Captain Hulbert will know where to find us. He
can spread his wings and follow."</p>

<p>"The <i>Vendetta</i>? Yes, she is pretty familiar with the bays and bights
of the Mediterranean. No doubt he will follow us, dear. But I should
like him to speak out before we go."</p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid you will be disappointed. He likes coming here&mdash;he
likes you and Isola, and perhaps he likes me, pretty well, after a
fashion; but sailors are generally fickle, are they not? And if he is
at all like his brother, Lord Lostwithiel, who seems to have a dreadful
reputation, judging by the way people talk of him here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is not like his brother in character or disposition. If he were, I
should be sorry for my sister to marry him."</p>

<p>"Have you such a very bad opinion of his brother?" asked Allegra,
shocked and grieved that any one closely allied to John Hulbert should
bear an evil repute.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that would be too much to say. I know so little about him. I
have scarcely seen him since he was a lad&mdash;only I have heard things
which have prejudiced me," continued Disney, lapsing into moody
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Was it not Mr. Crowther's insolence, and that alone, which had
prejudiced him against Lostwithiel&mdash;had made the very name hateful to
him? Yes, that was the cause of his aversion. He had disproved those
insolent insinuations; he had exploded the covert slander and rebuked
the slanderer; but he had not forgotten. The wound still rankled.</p>

<p class="center">"NO SUDDEN FANCY OF AN ARDENT BOY."</p>


<p>It was Christmas Eve. All things were arranged for departure on the
28th, which would give time for their arrival at San Remo on New Year's
Day. They were to travel by easy stages, by Amiens, Basle, and Lucerne.
A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> good deal of luggage had been sent off in advance, and trunks and
portmanteaux were packed ready for the start; so that the travellers
could take their ease during the few days of Christmas church-going and
festivity. Isola's spirits had improved wonderfully since the journey
had been decided upon.</p>

<p>"It seems like beginning a new life, Martin," she told her husband. "I
feel ever so much better already. I'm afraid I'm an impostor, and that
you are taking a great deal of unnecessary trouble on my account."</p>

<p>It was such a relief to think that she would see Vansittart Crowther
no more, that she could wander where she pleased without the hazard
of meeting that satyr-like countenance, those pale protruding eyes,
with malevolent stare&mdash;such a relief to know that she would be in
a new country, where no one would know anything about her, or have
any inclination to gossip about her. Something of her old gaiety and
interest in life revived at the prospect of those new surroundings.</p>

<p>They were to put up at an hotel for the first few days, so as to
take their time in looking for a villa. Two servants were to go with
them&mdash;the colonel's valet and handy-man, who was an old soldier, and
could turn his hand to anything in house, or stable, or garden; and the
baby's nurse, a somewhat masterful person of seven and twenty, from
the Fatherland, surnamed Grunhaupt, but known in the family by her
less formidable domestic diminutive Löttchen. Other hirelings would be
obtained at San Remo, but these two were indispensable&mdash;Holford, the
soldier-servant, to bear all burdens, and Löttchen to take charge of
the baby, to whom life was supposed to be impossible in any other care.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve&mdash;the mildest Christmas that had been known for
a long time, even in this sheltered corner of the coast. Allegra had
been busy all the morning, helping in the church decorations, and
co-operating with Mr. Colfox in various arrangements for the comfort
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> old and sick and feeble, among the cottages scattered over the
length and breadth of a large parish. She had walked a good many miles,
and she had stood for an hour in the church, toiling at the decoration
of the font, which had been assigned to her, and which she covered with
ferns, arbutus, and berberis foliage, in all their varieties of colour,
from darkest bronze to vivid crimson, starred with the whiteness of
Christmas roses; while the Miss Crowthers lavished the riches of the
Glenaveril hothouses upon the pulpit, keeping themselves studiously
aloof from Miss Leland.</p>

<p>Not a jot cared Allegra for their aloofness. She disliked their father,
and she knew that her brother detested him, without having any clear
idea of the cause. She was so thoroughly loyal to Martin that she would
have deemed it treason to like any one whom he disliked; so had the
daughters of Glenaveril been the most companionable young women in
Cornwall she would have considered it her duty to hold them at arm's
length. Glenaveril and all its belongings were taboo.</p>

<p>She was very tired when she went home at four o'clock, just on the edge
of dusk here&mdash;pitch dark, no doubt, in London and other great cities,
where the poor, pinched faces were flitting to and fro in the fitful
glare of the butcher's gas, intent on finding a Christmas joint to fit
the slenderest resources. Here, in this quiet valley, the reflected
sun-glow still brightened sky, sea, land, and river, and the lamps had
not yet been lighted in hall or drawing-room at the Angler's Nest.</p>

<p>There was a pleasant alternation of firelight and shadow in the long
double room, the flames leaping up every now and then, and lighting
wall and bookcase, picture and bust, the blue and red of the Mandarin
jars, and the golden storks on the black Japanese screen; but it was
such a capricious light that it did not show Allegra some one sitting
<i>perdu</i> in Martin Disney's deep elbow chair, a person who sat and
watched her with an admiring smile, as she flung off her little felt
hat and fur cape, and stretched her arms above her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> head in sheer
weariness, a graceful, picturesque figure, in her plain brown serge
gown, belted round the supple waist, and clasped at the throat, like
Enid's, and with never an ornament except the oxydized silver clasps,
and the serviceable chatelaine hanging at her side.</p>

<p>The tea-table was set ready in front of the fire, the large Moorish
tray on bamboo legs. But there was no sign of Isola; so Miss Leland
poured out a cup of tea and began to drink it, still unconscious of a
pair of dark eyes watching her from the shadow of the big armchair.</p>

<p>"And am I to have no tea, Miss Leland?" asked a voice out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>Allegra gave a little scream, and almost dropped her cup.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she exclaimed. "How can you startle any one like that?
How do you know that I have not heart disease?"</p>

<p>"I would as soon suspect the goddess Hygeia of that, or any other
ailment," said Captain Hulbert, rising to his full six feet two, out
of the low chair in the dark corner by the bookcase. "Forgive me for
my bearishness in sitting here while you were in the room. I could not
resist the temptation to sit and watch you for a minute or two while
you were unconscious of my presence. It was like looking at a picture.
While you are talking I am so intent upon what you say, and what you
think, that I almost forget to consider what you are like. To-night I
could gaze undistracted."</p>

<p>"What absolute nonsense you talk," said Allegra, with the sugar-tongs
poised above the basin. "One lump&mdash;or two?"</p>

<p>"One, two, three&mdash;anything you like&mdash;up to a million."</p>

<p>"Do you know that you nearly made me break a tea-cup&mdash;one of mother's
dear old Worcester tea-cups? I should never have forgiven you."</p>

<p>"But as you didn't drop the tea-cup, I hope you do forgive me for my
stolen contemplation, for sitting in my corner there and admiring you
in the firelight?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Firelight is very becoming. No doubt I looked better than in the
daytime."</p>

<p>"And you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. It is hardly worth while to be angry with you. I shall
be a thousand miles away next week. I could not carry my resentment so
far. It would cool on the journey."</p>

<p>"A thousand miles is not far for the <i>Vendetta</i>, Miss Leland. She would
make light of crossing the Pacific&mdash;for a worthy motive."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about motives; but I thought you were fairly
established at the Mount, and that you had made an end of your
wanderings."</p>

<p>"The Mount is only delightful&mdash;I might say endurable&mdash;when I have
neighbours at the Angler's Nest."</p>

<p>"Martin will let this house, perhaps, and you may have pleasant
neighbours in the new people."</p>

<p>"I am not like the domestic cat. It is not houses I care for, but
individuals. My affections would not transfer themselves to the new
tenants."</p>

<p>"How can you tell that? You think of them to-night as strangers&mdash;and
they seem intolerable. You would like them after a week, and be warmly
attached to them at the end of a month. Why, you have known us for less
than three months, and we fancy ourselves quite old friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Leland, is our friendship only fancy? Will a thousand miles
make you forget me?"</p>

<p>"No, we could not any of us be so ungrateful as to forget you,"
answered Allegra, struggling against growing embarrassment, wondering
if this tender tone, these vague nothings, were drifting towards a
declaration, or were as simply meaningless as much of the talk between
men and women. "We can't forget how kind you have been, and what
delightful excursions we have had on the <i>Vendetta</i>."</p>

<p>"The <i>Vendetta</i> will be at San Remo when you want her, Allegra. She
will be as much at your command there as she has been here; and her
skipper will be as much your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> slave as he is here&mdash;as he has been
almost ever since he saw your face."</p>

<p>This was not small talk. This meant something very serious. He had
called her Allegra, and she had not reproved him; he had taken her hand
and she had not withdrawn it. In the next instant, she knew not how,
his arm was round her waist, and her head, weary with the long day's
work and anxieties, was resting contentedly on his shoulder, while his
lips set their first kiss, tenderly, reverently almost, on her fair
broad brow.</p>

<p>"Allegra, this means yes, does it not? Our lives have flowed on
together so peacefully, so happily, since last October. They are to
mingle and flow on together to the great sea, are they not, love&mdash;the
sea of death and eternity."</p>

<p>"Do you really care for me?"</p>

<p>"Do I really adore you? Yes, dear love. With all my power of adoration."</p>

<p>"But you must have cared for other girls before now. I can't believe
that I am the first."</p>

<p>"Believe, at least, that you will be the last, as you are the only
woman I ever asked to be my wife."</p>

<p>"Is that really, really true?"</p>

<p>"It is true as the needle to the north."</p>

<p>"Yet they say that sailors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are generally tolerable dancers, and popular in a ball-room,
especially when they are the givers of the ball&mdash;that they can talk to
pretty women without feeling abashed&mdash;and that they contrive to get
through a good deal of flirting without singeing their wings. I have
waltzed with a good many nice girls in my time, Allegra, and I have
sat out a good many waltzes. Yet I am here at your side, honestly and
devotedly your own; and I have never loved any other woman with the
love I feel for you. No other woman has ever held my whole heart; no,
not for a single hour."</p>

<p>"You make nice distinctions," said Allegra, gently disengaging herself
from his arm, and looking at him with a faint, shy smile, very
doubtful, yet very anxious to believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> "I am dreadfully afraid that
all this fine talk means nothing more than you would say to any of your
partners, if you happened to be sitting out a waltz."</p>

<p>"Should I ask any of my partners to be my wife, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you can withdraw that to-morrow&mdash;forget and ignore it. We may both
consider it only a kind of under-the-mistletoe declaration, meaning no
more than a mistletoe kiss. I believe when English people were domestic
and kept Christmas, the head of the family would have kissed his cook
if he had met her under the mistletoe."</p>

<p>"Allegra, is it not cruel of you to be jocose when I am so tremendously
serious?"</p>

<p>"What if I don't believe in your seriousness?"</p>

<p>"Is this only a polite way of refusing me?" he asked, beginning to be
offended, not understanding that this nonsense-talk was a hasty defence
against overpowering emotion, that she was not sure of him, and was
desperately afraid of betraying herself. "Am I to understand that you
don't care a straw for me?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no," she cried eagerly, "as a friend, I like you better than
any one else in the world; only I don't want to give you more than
friendship till I can trust you well enough to believe in your love."</p>

<p>"Prove it, Allegra," he cried, clasping her waist again before she was
aware. "Put me to any test or any trial&mdash;impose any duty upon me. Only
tell me that if I come through the ordeal you will be my wife."</p>

<p>"You are not in a great hurry to fetter yourself, I hope?" she said.</p>

<p>"I am in a hurry&mdash;I long for those sweet fetters by which your love
will hold me. I want to be anchored by my happiness."</p>

<p>"Give me a year of freedom, a year for art and earnest work in Italy, a
year for Martin and Isola, who both want me; and if this night year you
are still of the same mind, I will be your wife. I will not engage you.
You may be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> free as air to change your mind and love some one else;
but I will promise to be true to you and to this talk of ours till the
year's end&mdash;one year from to-night."</p>

<p>"I accept your sentence, though it is severe; but I don't accept my
freedom. I am your slave for a year. I shall be your slave when the
year is out. I am yours, and yours alone for life. And now give me that
cup of tea, Allegra, which you have not poured out yet, and let us
fancy ourselves Darby and Joan."</p>

<p>"Darby and Joan," echoed Allegra, as she filled his cup. "Must we be
like that: old and prosy, sitting by the fire, while life goes by us
outside? It seems sad that there should be no alternative between slow
decay and untimely death."</p>

<p>"It is sad; but the world is made so. And then Providence steeps
elderly people in a happy hallucination. They generally forget that
they are old; or at least they forget that they ever were young, and
they think young people so ineffably silly that youth itself seems
despicable to their sober old minds. But you and I have a long life
to the good, dear love, before the coming of grey hairs and elderly
prejudices."</p>

<p>And then he began to talk of ways and means, as if they were going to
be married next week.</p>

<p>"We shall have enough for bread and cheese," he said. "I am better
off than a good many younger sons; for a certain old grandfather of
mine provided for the younger branches. It is quite possible that
Lostwithiel may never marry&mdash;indeed, he seems to me very decided
against matrimony, and in that case those who come after us must
inherit title and estate in days to come."</p>

<p>"Pray don't talk so," cried Allegra, horrified. "It sounds as if you
were speculating upon your brother's death."</p>

<p>"On Lostwithiel's death? Not for worlds. God bless him, wherever he may
be. You don't know how fond we two fellows are of each other. Only when
a man is going to be married it behoves him to think even of the remote
future. I shall have to talk to the colonel, remember; and he will
expect me to be business-like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you don't think Martin mercenary," said Allegra. "There never
was a man who set less value on money. It wouldn't make any difference
to him if you had not a penny. And as for me, I have a little income
from my mother&mdash;more than enough to buy frocks and things&mdash;and beyond
that I can earn my own living. So you really needn't trouble yourself
about me."</p>

<p>There was a touching simplicity in her speech, mingled with a slight
flavour of audacity, as of an emancipated young woman, which amused her
lover, reminding him of a heroine of Murger's, or Musset's, a brave
little grisette, who was willing to work hard for the <i>ménage à deux</i>,
and who wanted nothing from her lover but love. He looked into the
candid face, radiant in the fire-glow, and he told himself that this
was just the one woman for whom his heart had kept itself empty, like
a temple waiting for its god, in all the years of his manhood. And now
the temple doors had opened wide, the gates had been lifted up, and the
goddess had marched to her place, triumphant and all-conquering.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck six, and the old eight-day clock in
the hall followed like a solemn echo. Captain Hulbert started up. "So
late! Why, we have been talking for nearly two hours!" he exclaimed,
"and I have a budget of letters to write for the night mail. Good-bye,
darling&mdash;or I'll say <i>au revoir</i>, for I'll walk down again after
dinner, and get half an hour's chat with Disney, if you don't think it
will be too late for me to see him."</p>

<p>"You know he is always pleased to see you&mdash;we are not very early
people&mdash;and this is Christmas Eve. We were to sit round the fire and
tell ghost-stories, don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Of course we were. I shall be here soon after nine, and I shall think
over all the grizzly legends I ever heard, as I come down the hill."</p>

<p>He went reluctantly, leaving her standing by the fire, a contemplative
figure with downcast eyes. At a little later stage in their engagement
no doubt she would have gone with him to the door, or even out to the
garden gate, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> lingering parting under the stars&mdash;but there was
a shyness about them both in this sweet dim beginning of their union,
when it was so strange to each to have any claim upon the other.</p>

<p>"How lightly she took the whole business," Captain Hulbert said to
himself as he went up the hill. "Yet her voice trembled now and
then&mdash;and her hand was deadly cold when first I clasped it. I think she
loves me. A year,"&mdash;snapping his fingers gaily at the stars&mdash;"what is
a year? A year of bliss if it be mostly spent with her. Besides, long
engagements are apt to dwindle. I have seen such engagements&mdash;entered
on solemnly like ours to-night&mdash;shrink to six months, or less. Why
should one linger on the threshold of a new life, if one knows it is
going to be completely happy?"</p>

<p>The blissful lover had not been gone five minutes when Isola came
creeping into the room, and put her arm round Allegra's neck and kissed
her flushed cheek.</p>

<p>"Why, Isa, where have you been hiding all this evening?"</p>

<p>"I had fallen asleep in my room, just half an hour before tea, and
when I awoke it was five o'clock, and Löttchen told me you and Captain
Hulbert were in the drawing-room. And as I know you two have always so
much to talk about, I thought I wouldn't disturb you. So I let Löttchen
make tea for me in the nursery, and I stayed there to play with baby.
And here you are all in the dark."</p>

<p>"Oh, we had the firelight&mdash;Parker forgot to bring the lamp."</p>

<p>"And you forgot to ring for it," said Isola, going over to the
bow-window, and drawing back a curtain. "What a lovely sky! Who would
think it was Christmas-time?"</p>

<p>Tho moon was in her second quarter, shining brilliantly, in the deep
purple of a sky almost without a cloud.</p>

<p>"Will you put on your hat and jacket and come for a stroll in the
garden, Isa?" asked Allegra. "It is a mild, dry night, and I don't
think the air can hurt you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurt me! It will do me all the good in the world. Yes, I shall be
ready in a moment."</p>

<p>They went out into the hall, where Allegra packed her sister-in-law
carefully in a warm, fur-lined jacket, and flung a tartan shawl round
her own shoulders. Then they went out into the garden, and to the lawn
by the river. The moon was shining on the running water, brightly,
coldly, clear, while the meadows on the opposite bank were wrapped in
faint, white mists, which made all the landscape seem unreal.</p>

<p>"Are you not too tired for walking here after your long day, Allegra?"
Isola asked, when they had gone up and down the path two or three times.</p>

<p>"Tired, no. I could walk to Tywardreath. I could walk to the Mausoleum.
Shall we go there? The sea must be lovely under that moon."</p>

<p>"My dearest, it is nearly seven o'clock, and you have been tramping
about all day. If you are not very tired, you must be very much
excited, Allegra. I am longing to hear what it all means."</p>

<p>"Are you really, now? Do you care about it, Isola? Can you, who are
firmly anchored in the haven of marriage, feel any sentimental interest
in other people, tossing about on the sea of courtship? Martin is to be
told everything to-night&mdash;so you may as well know all about it now. You
like Captain Hulbert, don't you, Isola?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed. I like him, and believe in him."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! I should have been miserable if you had doubted
or disliked him. He is to be my husband some day, Isa, if Martin
approve&mdash;but not for a year, at least. Tell me, dear, are you glad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am very glad. God bless you, Allegra, and make your life
happy&mdash;and free&mdash;from&mdash;care."</p>

<p>She broke down with those last faltered words, and Allegra discovered
that she was crying.</p>

<p>"My dearest Isa, don't cry! I shall fancy you are sorry&mdash;that you think
him unworthy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, no. It is not that. He is worthy. He is all that I could
desire in the man who is to be your husband. No, I was only thinking
how completely happy you and he must be&mdash;how cloudless your life
promises to be. God keep you, and guard you, dear! And may you never
know the pain of parting with the husband you love&mdash;with your protector
and friend&mdash;as I have known it."</p>

<p>"Yes, love; but that is all past and done with. There are to be no more
farewells for you and Martin."</p>

<p>"No, it is past, thank God! Yet one cannot forget. I am very glad
Captain Hulbert has left the navy&mdash;that his profession cannot call him
away from you."</p>

<p>"No, he is an idle man. I dare say the time will come when I shall be
plagued with him, and be almost obliged to suggest that he should keep
race-horses, or go on the Stock Exchange, to occupy his time. I have
heard women say that it is terrible to have a stay-at-home husband. Yet
Martin is never <i>de trop</i>&mdash;but then Martin can bury himself in a book.
He has no fidgety ways."</p>

<p>"How lightly you talk, Allegra."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is because my heart is heavy&mdash;heavy, not with grief and
care, but with the burden of perplexity and surprise, with the fear
that comes of a great joy."</p>

<p>"You do love him, then?" said Isola, earnestly. "You are glad."</p>

<p>"I am very glad. I am glad with all my heart."</p>

<p>"God bless you, dearest! I rejoice in your happiness."</p>

<p>They kissed again, this time with tears on both sides; for Allegra was
now quite overcome, and sobbed out her emotion upon her sister's neck;
they two standing clasped in each other's arms beside the river.</p>

<p>"When I am dead, Allegra, remember always that I loved you, and that I
rejoiced in your happiness as if it were my own."</p>

<p>"When you are dead! How dare you talk like that, when we are taking you
away to get well and strong, and to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> ever so many years beyond
your golden wedding? Was there ever such ingratitude?"</p>

<p>Tho odour of tobacco stole on the evening air, and they heard Martin's
firm tread approaching along the gravel path.</p>

<p>Isola put her arm through his, while Allegra ran into the house, and
husband and wife walked up and down two or three times in the darkness,
she telling him all about the wonderful thing that had happened.</p>

<p>"You are glad, are you not, Martin? You are as glad as I am?"</p>

<p>"Are you so very glad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for I know that Allegra loves him, has loved him for a long time."</p>

<p>"Meaning six weeks or so&mdash;allowing a fortnight for the process of
falling in love. Is that what you call a long time, Isola?"</p>

<p>"Weeks are long sometimes," she answered, slowly, as if her thoughts
had wandered into another channel.</p>

<p>"Well, if Allegra is pleased, I suppose I ought to be content,"
said Disney. "Hulbert seems a fine, frank fellow, and I have never
heard anything to his discredit. He was popular in the navy, and was
considered a man of marked ability. I dare say people will call him a
good match for Allegra, so long as Lostwithiel remains a bachelor."</p>

<p>"No one can be too good for Allegra, and only the best of men can be
good enough. If I had my own way, I should have liked her to remain
always unmarried, and to care for nothing but her nephew and you. I
should have liked to think of her as always with you."</p>

<p>The triangular dinner-party was gayer that evening than it had been for
a long time. Isola was in high spirits, and her husband was delighted
at the change from that growing apathy which had so frightened him.
The ladies had scarcely left the table when Captain Hulbert arrived,
and was ushered into the dining-room, where Martin Disney was smoking
his after-dinner pipe in the chimney corner&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>the old chimney corner
of that original Angler's Nest, which had been a humble homestead two
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The two men shook hands, and then John Hulbert seated himself on the
opposite side of the hearth, and they began to talk earnestly of the
future, Martin Disney speaking with fond affection of the sister who
had been to him almost as a daughter.</p>

<p>"Her mother was the sweetest and truest of women," he said, "and her
father had one of the most refined and delicate natures I ever met
with in a man. I do not know that he was altogether fitted for the
Church. He was wanting in energy and decision, or force of character;
but he was a firm believer, pure-minded and disinterested, and he was
an artist to the tips of his fingers. It is from him Allegra inherits
her love of art; only while he was content to trifle with art she has
worked with all the power of her strong, resolute temperament. She
inherits that from her mother's line, which was a race of workers, men
with whom achievement was a necessity of existence&mdash;men who fought, and
men who thought&mdash;sword and gown."</p>

<p>Disney smiled at the stern condition of a year's probation which
Allegra had imposed upon her lover.</p>

<p>"Such sentences are very often remitted," he said.</p>

<p>"I own to having some hope of mercy," replied Captain Hulbert. "People
have an idea that May marriages are unlucky; and perhaps we had better
defer to a popular superstition. But it seems to me that June is a
capital month for a yachtsman's honeymoon; and if I can persuade my
dearest to remit half my period of probation, and fix the 1st of June
for our wedding, I should be just half a year happier than I am now."</p>

<p>"Have you any notion yet what kind of life you are to lead after your
marriage? I hope it will not be a roving life. Isola and I would like
to have our sister near us."</p>

<p>"And Allegra and I would like to study your liking," laughed Hulbert.
"We may wander a little on summer seas, but we will have our fixed
abode, and it shall be near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> you. So long as Lostwithiel is a bachelor,
we can make our home at the Mount; but fond as I am of that dear old
place, I should be glad to see my brother married. There is something
amiss in his present mode of life; and I have but too strong reason to
fear that he is not a happy man."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of the cause of his unhappiness?"</p>

<p>"Only speculative ideas&mdash;mere theories that may be without foundation
in fact. I fancy that he has burnt the lamp of life a little too
furiously, and that the light has grown dim in the socket. The
after-taste of a fiery youth is the taste of dust and ashes. There may
be memories, too&mdash;memories of some past folly&mdash;which are bitter enough
to poison his life. I know that he is unhappy. I have tried to find out
the cause; and it all ends in this&mdash;an obstinate reserve on his part,
and mere theorizing on mine."</p>

<p>"I have heard that he lived in a bad set after he left the University?"</p>

<p>"A bad set&mdash;yes, that is it. A man who begins life in a certain circle
is like a workman who gets his arm or his leg caught unawares in a
machine worked by steam power. In an instant he is entangled past
rescue. He is gone. A man takes the wrong road. Ten years afterwards,
perhaps, when he is bald and wrinkled, he may pull himself up on the
downward track and try to get rid of a bad reputation and make a fresh
start; but those fresh starts rarely end in a winning race. I am very
sorry for my brother. He is a warm-hearted fellow, with a good deal of
talent; and he ought not to have made a bad thing of his life."</p>

<p>"Let us hope that he has pulled up in time, and that he may get a young
wife before he is many years older. I have no desire that my sister's
son should be a peer. I only want to see her happy with a husband who
shall be worthy of her."</p>

<p class="center">"I HAVE YOU STILL, THE SUN COMES OUT AGAIN."</p>


<p>The new year was just a week old, and Isola and Allegra were standing
on a terraced hillside in a country where January has noontides as
brilliant and balmy as an English June. They had travelled up that
almost perpendicular hill in a roomy landau drawn by a pair of strong
horses, and now, near the summit of the hill, on the last of those
many terraces that zig-zag up the face of the cliff, they had alighted
from the carriage, and were standing side by side upon the broad white
road, at an angle where the cliff dipped suddenly, clothed with the
wild growth of stunted olive and bushy pine, down and down to the abyss
where the blue sea looked like a sapphire at the bottom of a pit. They
stood and gazed, and gazed again, almost bewildered by the infinite
beauty and variety of that dazzling prospect.</p>

<p>Below them, in the shelter of the land-locked bay, Ospedaletti's
pavilioned Casino shone whitely out of a garden of palm and cactus,
with terrace and balustrade vanishing down by the sea. To the right,
the steep promontory of Bordighera jutted far out into the blue; and
over the rugged crest of the hill Mentone's long white front lay in a
gentle curve, almost level with the sea&mdash;a strip of vivid white between
the blue of the water and the gloom of that great barren mountain wall
which marks the beginning of modern Italy. And beyond, again, showed
the twin towers of Monaco; and further still, in the dim blue distance,
rose the battlemented line of the Esterelles, dividing the fairyland
of the Riviera from the workaday realities of shipbuilding Toulon and
commercial Marseilles.</p>

<p>On this side of those pine-clad mountains there were only pleasure and
fancy, wealth, fashion, the languid invalid, and the feverish gambler;
on the other side there were toilers and speculators, the bourse and
the port, the world of stern fact.</p>

<p>To the left, deep down within the hills, lay the little har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>bour of San
Remo, with its rugged stone pier and its shabby old houses, and the
old, old town climbing up the steep ascent to that isolated point where
the white dome of the Sanctuary shone out against the milky azure of
the noontide sky; and further and further away stretched the long line
of the olive-clothed hills, to the purple distance, where the seamen's
church of Madonna della Guardia stands boldly out between sky and sea,
as if it were a half-way house on the road to heaven.</p>

<p>"How lovely it all is!" cried Allegra. "But don't you feel that one
careless step upon that flowery edge yonder would send us whirling down
the cliffs to awful, inevitable death? When that man passed us just now
with his loaded cart, I felt sick with fear&mdash;the wheels seemed to graze
the brink of the abyss as the horse crept slowly along&mdash;poor stolid
brute!&mdash;unconscious of his danger. It is a dreadful drive, Isola, this
zig-zag road to Colla&mdash;slant above slant, backwards and forwards, up
the face of this prodigious cliff. I had to shut my eyes at every turn
of the road, when the world below seemed to swim in a chaos of light
and colour&mdash;so beautiful, so terrible! Do you see the height of those
cliffs, terrace above terrace, hill above hill? Why, that level road at
the very bottom is the top of a taller cliff than those I used to think
so appalling at Broadstairs and Ramsgate!"</p>

<p>"I don't think it would make much difference to a man who fell over
the edge whether he fell here or in the Isle of Thanet," said Martin
Disney, as he stood, with his arm drawn through his wife's, sweeping
the prospect with his field glass.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it would! One would be only a sudden shock and a plunge into
the sea, or swift annihilation on the rocks below; but from this awful
height&mdash;think of the horror of it! To go whirling down, plucked at here
by an olive branch, or there by a jagged rock, yet always whirling
downward, rebounding from edge to edge, faster, and faster, and faster,
till one were dashed into a shapeless mass on that white road yonder!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"And to think of people living up there in the clouds, and going to
sleep every night with the knowledge of this mighty wall and that
dreadful abyss in their minds!" she concluded, pointing upward to where
the little white town of Colla straggled along the edge of the hill.</p>

<p>They were going up to see the pictures and books in the little museum
by the church. It was their first excursion, since their arrival in
Italy, for Martin Disney had been anxious that his wife should be
thoroughly rested after her long journey, before she was called upon
to make the slightest exertion. She was looking better and stronger
already, they were both agreed; and she was looking happier, a fact
which gave her husband infinite satisfaction. They had come by the
St. Gothard, had rested a night at Dover and a night at Basle, and
had stopped at Lucerne for three days, and again a couple of days at
Milan, and again at Genoa, exploring the city, and the Campo Santo in
a leisurely way; Allegra exalted out of herself almost by the delight
of those wonderful collections in the palaces of the Via Balbi&mdash;the
Veroneses, the Titians, the Guidos&mdash;Isola languidly admiring, languidly
wondering at everything, but only deeply moved when they came to the
strange city of the dead, the scenic representation of sickness,
calamity, grief and dissolution, in every variety of realistic
representation or of classic emblem. Sculptured scenes of domestic
sorrow, dying fathers, kneeling children, weeping widows&mdash;whole
families convulsed in the throes of that last inevitable parting;
the death of youth and beauty; the fallen rose-wreath; the funeral
urn; the lowered torch; hyacinth and butterfly; Psyche and Apollo;
the fatal river and the fatal boat; grimness and beauty&mdash;the actual
and the allegorical curiously mixed in the sculptured images that
line the cold white colonnades, where the footsteps of holiday-makers
echo with a sepulchral sound under the vaulted roof. Here Isola was
intensely interested, and insisted on going up the marble steps, flight
after flight, and to the very summit of the hill of graves, with its
wide-reaching prospect of mountain, and fort, and city, and sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think how hard it must be to lie here and know nothing of all that
loveliness," she said, her eyes widening with wonder as they gazed
across the varied perspective of vale and mountain, out to the faint
blue sea. "How hard, how hard! Do they feel it and know it, Allegra?
Can this I&mdash;which feels so keenly, which only sleeps in order to enter
a new world of dreams&mdash;busier and more crowded and more eventful than
the real world&mdash;can this consciousness go out all at once like the
flame of a candle&mdash;and nothing, nothing, nothing be left?"</p>

<p>"They are not here," said Allegra, with gentle seriousness. "It is only
the husk that lies here&mdash;the flower-seed has been carried off in God's
great wind of death&mdash;and the flower is blossoming somewhere else."</p>

<p>"One allegory is as good as another," said Isola. "We can but console
ourselves with symbols. I don't like this crowded city of the dead,
Allegra. For God's sake, don't let Martin have me buried here, if I
should die at San Remo!"</p>

<p>"Dearest, why will you harbour such ghastly thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was only a passing fancy. I thought it just possible that if I
were to die while we are in Italy, Martin might think to honour me by
having me laid in this splendid cemetery. He seemed so struck by the
grandeur and beauty of the monuments, just now, when we were in those
colonnades down yonder."</p>

<p>Colonel Disney had lingered a little way off to look at Mazzini's
monument. He came up to them now, and hurried them back to the gate,
where their carriage was waiting. And so ended their last afternoon in
Genoa; and the most vivid picture of the city and its surroundings that
Isola carried away with her was the picture of those marble tombs upon
the hill, and those tall and gloomy cypresses which are the trees of
death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yes, she was better, gayer, and more active&mdash;more like the girl-wife
whom Martin Disney had carried home to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> Cornwall, prouder than Tristram
when he sailed away with Irish Isolt.</p>

<p>The Italian sunshine had revived his fading flower, Disney told
himself, ready to love all things in a land that had brought the smiles
back to his wife's pale lips, and a delicate bloom to her wan cheeks.
Yes, she was happier than she had been of late in Cornwall. He saw and
rejoiced in the change.</p>

<p>They stayed at a hotel for more than a week, while they deliberated
upon the choice of a villa. They found one at last, which seemed to
realize their ideas of perfection. It was not a grand or stately
dwelling. No marble bell-tower or architectural loggia attracted the
eye of the passing pedestrian. It was roomy, and bright, and clean, and
airy, built rather in the Swiss than the Italian style, and it stood
upon the slope of the hill on the west side of the town, with nothing
but olive-woods between its terraced garden and the road that skirted
the sea. It was a reminiscence of the Alps, built by a retired merchant
of Zurich, and its owner had called it Lauter Brunnen. The house was
at most two years old; but life's vicissitudes had left it empty for
a year and a half, and the rent asked of Colonel Disney was much less
than he had been prepared to pay.</p>

<p>The installation was full of delight for Isola and her sister-in-law.
The house afforded innumerable surprises, unexpected nooks and corners
of all kinds. There were lovely views from every window&mdash;east, west,
north, or south&mdash;and there was a garden full of roses, a garden made
upon so steep a slope that it was a succession of terraces, with but
little intervening level ground, and below the lowest terrace the
valley stretched down to the sea, a tangle of gnarled old olive trees,
wan and silvery, with a ruined gateway just seen among the foliage at
the bottom of a dim grey glade.</p>

<p>To the right, straggling along the edge of the wooded hill, appeared
the white houses and churches, cupola, pinnacle, and dome of Colla, so
scattered as to seem two towns rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> than one, and with picturesque
suggestions of architectural splendour that were hardly borne out by
the reality, when one climbed those rugged mule-paths, and crossed the
romantic gorge above the waterfall, and then upward and upward to the
narrow alleys and crumbling archways, and the spacious old church with
its lofty doorway standing high above the stony street.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Only a few paces from Colonel Disney's villa there was a stately house
that had gone to ruin. The roof was off in some places; there were
neither floors nor windows left; and the walls were open to the wind
and rain&mdash;frescoed walls, upon which might be traced figures of saint
and martyr, angel and madonna. There was a spacious garden, with an
avenue of cypresses&mdash;a garden where the flowers had been growing wild
for years, and where Isola and Allegra wandered and explored as they
pleased. It was higher on the hillside than their own villa, and from
the eastward edge of this garden they looked&mdash;across a yawning gulf
in which lay all the lower town of San Remo&mdash;to the Sanctuary and the
Leper Hospital, conspicuous on the crest of the opposite hill.</p>

<p>The need for Citadel and Sanctuary had passed with the fiercer age in
which they were built. Neither Saracen nor pirate menaced San Remo
nowadays; but the old white walls made a picturesque note in the
landscape, and the very name of Sanctuary had a romantic sound.</p>

<p>The first week in the new house was like a week in fairyland. The
weather was peerless&mdash;a climate that makes people forget there is such
a season as winter in the world&mdash;and the two girls wandered about in
the olive woods and climbed the mule-paths all through the fresh balmy
hours or in the hottest noontides sat in the deserted garden or in
a sheltered corner near an old stone well&mdash;one of those wells which
suggest the meeting of Isaac and Rebecca&mdash;and Allegra painted while
Isola read to her, in the low sweet voice which lent new and individual
music to the sweetest verse of her favourites, Byron, Keats, and
Shelley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>In these sequestered spots, where only a peasant woman laden with a
basket of olives, or a padre, going from Colla to San Remo, ever passed
within sight of them, they read the Eve of St. Agnes and the Pot of
Basil&mdash;the Prisoner of Chillon, Manfred, and all those familiar lyrics
and favourite passages of Shelley which Isola held in her heart of
hearts. The wonder-dream of Alastor&mdash;the passionate lament of Adonaïs,
could not seem purer or more spiritual than the life of these young
women in those calm days through which January slipped into February,
unawares, like a link in a golden chain&mdash;a chain of sunshine and
flowers.</p>

<p>In February came the Carnival; and pretty little rustic San Remo decked
itself with bunting and greenery, and made believe to hold a Battle
of Flowers, which had a certain village simplicity as compared with
the serried ranks of carriages, the fashion, and beauty, and wealth
of floral displays, along the Promenade des Anglais or the Croisette.
With the Carnival came the mistral, which generally seems to be waiting
round the corner ready to leap out upon the flower-throwers, to blight
their bouquets, and blow dust into the eyes of beauty, and make the
feeble health-seekers cower in the corners of their rose-decked
carriages. This Lenten season was no exception to other seasons; and
the calendar&mdash;which had been as it were in abeyance since New Year's
Day&mdash;came into force again&mdash;and stern and sterile Winter said, "Here
am I. Did you think I had forgotten you?" The invalids were roughly
awakened from their dream of Paradise, to discover that February even
in San Remo meant February, and could not always be mistaken for May or
June.</p>

<p>Isola felt the change, though she was hardly conscious of it on the
day of the floral battle, when she was sitting in a roomy landau,
covered with the dark shining foliage and pale yellow fruit from some
of those lemon trees in the orchard where she and Allegra had spent
their morning hours. Allegra had planned the decorations, and had gone
down to the coach-house to assist in the work, delighted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> chatter
with the coachman in doubtful Italian, groping her way in a language in
which her whole stock-in-trade consisted of a few quotations from Dante
or Petrarch&mdash;and all the wise saws of Dr. Riccabocca.</p>

<p>"I would have none of that horrid pepper tree which pervades the
place with its floppy foliage, and dull red fruit," she told Isola,
descanting on the result of her exertions. "I was rather taken with the
pepper trees at first, but I am satiated with their languid grace. They
are like the weeping ash or the weeping willow. There is no real beauty
in them. I would rather have one of those cypresses towering up among
the grey-green olives in the valley below Colla than all the pepper
trees in the public gardens. I have used no flowers but narcissus;
no colour but the pale gold of the lemons and the dark green of the
leaves; except one bit of audacity which you will see presently."</p>

<p>This was at noon, after two hours' work in the coach-house. An hour
later the carriage was at the door.</p>

<p>Allegra's audacity was an Algerian curtain, a rainbow of vivid colour,
with which she had draped the back of the landau, hiding all the
ugliness of rusty leather. The carriage, or it might have been the two
girlish faces in it, one so pale and gentle, the other so brilliant
and changeful in its lights and shadows, made the point of attraction
in the little procession. Everybody spoke of the two girls in the
lemon landau, with the nice-looking, middle-aged man. Were they his
daughters, people wondered, or his nieces; and at what hotel were they
staying? It was a disappointment to discover that they were living in
that villa to the west of the town, out of the way of everything and
everybody, and that they were seldom to be seen in public, except at
the new church, where they were regular worshippers.</p>

<p>"The man is Colonel Disney, and the tall, striking-looking girl is his
wife," said one person better informed than the rest, but making a
wrong selection all the same.</p>

<p class="center">"THOU PARADISE OF EXILES, ITALY."</p>


<p>Isola was not quite so well after that drive in the February wind and
dust. She developed a slight cough&mdash;very slight and inoffensive; but
still it was a cough&mdash;and the kind and clever physician of San Remo,
who came to see her once a week or so, told her to be careful. Mr.
Baynham had written him a long letter about his patient, and the San
Remo doctor felt a friendly interest in Isola and her sister-in-law,
and the baby son in whom the whole family were so intensely interested.
The infant had accepted the change in his surroundings with supreme
complaisance, and crowed and chirruped among the lemons and the
olives, and basked in the Southern sunshine, as his nurse wheeled his
perambulator to and fro upon the terraced road behind the villa&mdash;the
road which lost itself a little way further on amidst a wilderness of
olives, and dwindled into a narrow track for man or mule.</p>

<p>The flower-battle was over, and the mistral had gone back to the great
wind-cavern to lie in wait for the next golden opportunity; and the
sun was shining once again upon the hills where the oil mills nestled,
clinging to some rough ledge beside the ever-dropping waters, upon
the labyrinthine lanes and alleys, the queer little flights of stone
steps up which a figure like Ali Baba might generally be seen leading
his heavily-laden, long-suffering donkey; upon arch and cupola, church
and market-place, and on the triple rampart of hills that shuts San
Remo from the outer world. The Disneys had been in Italy nearly seven
weeks, and it seemed as natural to Isola to open her eyes upon the
broad blue waters of the Mediterranean, the gorgeous sunrise, and the
lateen sails, as on the Fowey river and the hills towards Polruan. She
had taken kindly to this Italian exile. The sun and the blue sky had
exercised a healing influence upon that hidden wound which had once
made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> her heart seem one dull, aching pain. She loved this new world of
wood and hill, and most of all she loved the perfect liberty of this
distant retreat, and the consolations of solitude. As for the cough,
or the pain in her side, or any of those other symptoms about which
the doctor talked to her so gravely, she made very light of them. She
was happy in her husband's love, happy in his society, strolling with
him in the olive wood, or the deserted garden, or down to the little
toy-shop parade by the sea, where the band played once a week; or to
the other garden in the town, where the same band performed on another
day, and which was dustier and less airy than the little plantation
of palm and cactus upon the edge of the sea. She went for excursions
with him to points of especial beauty high up among the hills&mdash;to the
chocolate mill, to San Romolo, she riding a donkey, he at the animal's
side, while the guide trudged cheerily in the dust at the edge of the
mountain road. In the evening she played to him, or sat by his side
while he smoked the pipe of rest, or worked while he read to her. They
had never been more devoted to each other, never more like wedded
lovers than they were now. People who only knew them by sight talked of
them admiringly, as if their love were an interesting phenomenon.</p>

<p>"He must be twenty years older than his wife," said Society, "and yet
they seem so happy together. It is quite refreshing to see such a
devoted couple nowadays."</p>

<p>People always seem ready and rather pleased to hold their own age up
to contempt and ridicule, as if they themselves did not belong to
it; as if they were sitting aloft in a balloon, looking down at the
foolish creatures crawling and crowding upon the earth, in a spirit of
philosophical contemplation.</p>

<p>Only one anxiety troubled Isola at this time, and that was on Allegra's
account rather than her own. They had left England nearly two months,
and as yet there had been no sign or token of any kind from Captain
Hulbert, not so much as a packet of new books or new music&mdash;not so much
as a magazine or an illustrated paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"He asked if he might write to me, and I told him no," Allegra said,
rather dolefully, one morning, as they sat a little way from the
well, Allegra engaged in painting a brown-skinned peasant girl of ten
years old, whom she had met carrying olives the night before, and had
forthwith engaged as a model. "I said it would never do for us to begin
the folly of engaged lovers, who write to each other about nothing,
sometimes twice a day. He has been wonderfully obedient: yet I think
he ought to have written once or twice in two months. He ought to have
known that though I told him not to write, I should be very anxious to
hear from him."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be surprised at his obeying you to the letter, Allegra.
There is a kind of simplicity about him, although he is very clever. He
is so thoroughly frank and honest. It is for that I honour him."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is very good," sighed Allegra. "I ought not to have told him
I would have no letter-writing. I really meant what I said. I wanted
to give myself up to art, and you, for the unbroken year&mdash;to have no
other thought, no distractions&mdash;and I knew that his letters would be a
distraction&mdash;that the mere expectation of them&mdash;the looking for post
time&mdash;the wondering whether I should have his letter by this or that
post&mdash;I knew all that kind of thing would unnerve me. My hand would
have lost its power. You don't know what it is when all depends upon
certainty of touch&mdash;the fine obedience of the hand to the eye. No, his
letters would have been a daily agitation&mdash;and yet, and yet I should
like so much to know what he is doing&mdash;if he is still at the Mount&mdash;if
he has any idea of coming to San Remo later&mdash;with his yacht&mdash;as he
talked of doing."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt he will come. It will be the most natural thing for
him to do. You will see the white sails some afternoon, glorified in
the sunset, like that boat yonder with its amethyst-coloured sail."</p>

<p>Isola was right in her prophecy, except as to the hour of Captain
Hulbert's arrival. They were taking a picnic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> luncheon in a little
grove of lemon and orange, wedged into a cleft in the hills, on the
edge of a deep and narrow gorge down which a mountain torrent rushed
to the sea. Suddenly across the narrow strip of blue at the end of the
vista came the vision of white sails, a schooner with all her canvas
spread, dazzling in the noonday sun, sailing towards San Remo. Allegra
sat gazing at the white sails, but said never a word. Neither Martin
Disney nor his wife happened to be looking that way, till the child in
his nurse's lap gave a sudden crow of delight.</p>

<p>"Did he see the pretty white ship, then?" said the nurse, holding him
up in the sunshine. "The beautiful white ship."</p>

<p>No one took any notice. The colonel was reading his <i>Times</i>, the chief
link between the exile and civilization. Isola was intent upon knitting
a soft white vestment for her firstborn.</p>

<p>Two hours later the garden gate gave a little click, and Captain
Hulbert walked in. Allegra heard the click of the latch as she sat
in the verandah, and ran out to meet him. She had been watching and
expectant all the time, though she had held her peace about the vision
of white sails, lest she should be suspected of hoping for her lover's
coming, and, above all, lest she should be compassionated with later in
the day, if the ship were not the <i>Vendetta</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, it was he. She turned pale with delight at the realization of her
hope. She had hardly known till this instant how much she loved him.
She let him take her in his arms and kiss her, just as if he had been
the commonest sailor whose "heart was true to Poll."</p>

<p>"Are you really glad to see me, darling?" he whispered, overcome by the
delight of this fond welcome.</p>

<p>"Really glad. I feel as if we had been parted for years. No letter to
tell me where you were or what you were doing! I began to doubt if you
ever cared for me."</p>

<p>"Heartless infidel, you told me not to write; and so I thought the
only alternative was to come. And I have been coming for the last five
weeks. We had a stiffish time across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> the bay&mdash;nothing to trust to but
canvas; and I had to waste a week at Toulon while my ship was under
repairs. However, here I am, and the <i>Vendetta</i> is safe and sound; and
I am your most obedient slave. How is Mrs. Disney?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so well as she was two or three weeks ago. She improved
wonderfully at first, but she caught cold one bleak, blowy day, and
she has started a little nervous kind of cough, which makes us anxious
about her."</p>

<p>"Better spirits, I hope. Not quite so mopy?"</p>

<p>"Her spirits have revived wonderfully. This lovely land has given
her a new life. But there are times when she droops a little. She is
curiously sensitive&mdash;too impressionable for happiness. We have a very
fine preacher here&mdash;Father Rodwell; you must have heard him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard of him at Oxford. He was before my time by some years;
but he was a celebrity, and I heard men talk of him. Well, what of your
preacher? Has he fallen in love with my Allegra&mdash;is he in the same boat
as poor Colfox?"</p>

<p>"Fallen in love! No, he is not that kind of man. He is as earnest and
enthusiastic as a mediæval monk. We have all been carried away by his
eloquence. He preaches what people call awakening sermons; and I fear
they have been too agitating for Isola. She insists on hearing him; she
hangs upon his words; but his preaching has too strong an influence
upon her mind&mdash;or upon her nerves. I have seen the tears streaming down
her poor pale cheeks; I have seen her terribly overcome. She is too
weak to bear that kind of strain. She is depressed all the rest of the
day."</p>

<p>"She ought not to be allowed to hear such sermons. Take her to another
church, where some dozy old bird will send her comfortably to sleep."</p>

<p>"I have tried to take her to the other church&mdash;you must not talk of a
clergyman as a dozy old bird, sir&mdash;but she looked so unhappy at the
mere idea of missing Father Rodwell's sermons that I dare not press the
matter. He comes to see us occasionally, and he is the cheeriest and
pleasantest of men, nothing of the zealot or ascetic about him; so that
I am in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> hopes his influence will be for good in the long run. How long
shall you be able to stop at San Remo?"</p>

<p>"Till the lady for whose sake I came shall take it into her head to
leave the place. I have been thinking, Allegra," putting his arm
through hers, and pacing up and down the terrace, with the bright
expanse of sea in front of them, and at their back the great curtain of
hills encircling and defending them from the wintry world&mdash;"I have been
thinking that Venice would be a charming place for you and me to spend
next summer in&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;you meant six months instead of twelve for my
probation&mdash;as I really think you must have done. We could be married
on the first of June&mdash;such a pretty date for a wedding! So easy to
remember! You would want to be married in Trelasco Church, of course;
on our native soil. The church in which my great-grandfather was
married, and in which I and all my race were christened! We could have
the yacht at Marseilles ready to carry us off on our travels, through
the delicious summer days and nights, all along this lovely coast, and
away by Naples to the Adriatic. Allegra, why should we wait for the
winter, the dreary winter, to begin our life journey? Let us begin it
in the time of roses."</p>

<p>"Look, John!" cried Allegra, laughing, as she pointed to the hedge of
red roses in front of them, and the clusters of creamy bloom hanging
over the verandah. "The roses have been blooming ever since we came
to Italy. It is always rose-time here. You remember our reading in
the dedication of 'To Leeward' how Marion Crawford strewed his wife's
pathway with roses on Christmas Day at Sorrento. We can find a flowery
land for our honeymoon at any season of the year."</p>

<p>"But why wait a year? Can you not prove me trusty and true in less than
a year?"</p>

<p>"You are so impatient," she said, plucking a handful of roses, and
scattering the petals at her feet. "A year is so short a time."</p>

<p>"Short, love! why, eight weeks have seemed an eternity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> to me without
you; and you honoured me just now by saying that the time had appeared
long, even to you&mdash;even to my liege lady, sitting serene in her palace
of art, painting contadinas and their olive-faced offspring&mdash;even to
you, whose love is as a thread of silk against a cable, compared to
mine. Even to you, my mistress and my tyrant."</p>

<p>"That was because you were so far away. But there will be nothing to
hinder our seeing each other, as often as you may find convenient. I
have set my heart upon painting steadily for a twelvemonth, without any
distractions."</p>

<p>"There is no such place as Venice for a painter. Think of the Miss
Montalbas, and the splendid work they have done at Venice. Would you
not like to be like them?"</p>

<p>"Would I not like to be like Apelles?"</p>

<p>"Well, Venice will be your treasury; Venice will fill that busy brain
with ideas. You shall be fed upon pictures old and new&mdash;the new living
pictures in the narrow streets and canals; the old masters in the
churches and palaces. You shall learn of Tintoret and Veronese. You
shall paint as much as you like. You shall have no distractions. We
shall be strangers there, can live as we choose. Summer is the time
for Venice, Allegra. Benighted English people have an idea that Italy
is a place to winter in, and they go and shiver in marble palaces, and
watch the torrential rain beating against windows that were never meant
to shut out bad weather. The Italians know that their land is a land
of summer, and they know how to enjoy sunny days and balmy nights. You
don't know how delicious life is on the Lido when the night is only a
brief interval of starshine betwixt sunset and dawn. You don't know
what a dream of delight it is to float along the lagoons and watch the
lamp-lit city melt into the mists of evening, breathing faint echoes
of music and song. A great many things of beauty have been turned to
ugliness, Allegra, since printing and the steam engine were invented;
but, thank God! Venice is not one of them. You will think of my plan,
won't you, love? At the least, it is a thing to be considered."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anything you say is worthy to be considered, John. And now come in and
see Isola and Martin."</p>

<p>He felt that he had gone far enough&mdash;he felt that it were unwise to
press the question too much at first. He meant to be gently persistent;
and he meant to have his own way.</p>

<p>He followed Allegra into the drawing-room&mdash;a room full of light and
sunshine, which had been beautified and made home-like by the addition
of a few Japaneseries and a little old Italian furniture which Martin
Disney had picked up at a bric-à-brac shop in the Via Vittorio
Emanuelo. There were flowers everywhere, in the bright Italian pottery,
so artless, so cheap, so gay, in its varieties of form and colouring.
To Hulbert's fancy it was the prettiest room he had seen for an age.</p>

<p>"You seem to have made yourself uncommonly comfortable here," he said,
after cordial greetings, settling down into a bamboo chair near Isola's
little olive-wood table, littered with Tauchnitz novels and fancy work.
"It is a pleasant sensation for a rolling stone who has hardly ever
known what home means to drop into such a nest as this. You will have
too much of my company, I'm afraid. You'll be shocked to hear that I
have taken rooms at the Anglais, down there," pointing down the valley,
"within a stone's throw of you."</p>

<p>"We are not shocked. We are very glad you will be near us," said Isola,
smiling at him. "It has been a dull life for Allegra, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Dull! dull in this land of beauty!" cried Allegra. "I have never known
a dull hour since I came here; though, of course," with a shy glance at
her lover, "I have naturally thought sometimes of absent friends, and
wished they were with me to revel in the loveliness of these woods and
hills."</p>

<p>"Well, one of your friends has come to you, one who would as gladly
have come had you been in regions where the sun never shines, or where
his chariot wheels scorch the torrid sands."</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert stayed with them all the evening, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> planned a sail
to Mentone for the following day, Isola again begging to be left out of
their plans, as she had done at Fowey.</p>

<p>"You need feel no compunction about leaving me," she paid. "I shall be
perfectly happy in the woods with nurse, and baby, and my books."</p>

<p>They obeyed her, and the little excursion was arranged. They were to
start soon after the early breakfast, carrying what their Italian
cook called a pique-nique with them, in the shape of a well-provided
luncheon-basket. Isola sat in the olive wood, watching the white sails
moving slowly towards Bordighera. It was an exquisite day&mdash;a day
for dreaming on the water rather than for rapid progress. The yacht
scarcely seemed to move as Isola watched her from the cushioned corner
which Löttchen had arranged in an angle of the low stone wall&mdash;all
amongst ferns and mosses, brown orchises and blue violets&mdash;an angle
sheltered by a century-old olive, whose gnarled trunk sprawled along
the ground, rugged and riven, but with another century's life in it
yet. Far down in the valley, below the old gateway, a company of
cypresses rose dark against the blue of the sea, and Isola knew that
just on that slope of the shore where the cypresses grew tallest the
graves of English exiles were gathered. Many a fair hope, many a broken
dream, many a disappointed ambition lay at rest under those dark
spires, within the sound of that summer sea.</p>

<p>This was one of many days which the young mother spent in the woods or
in the garden with her baby for her companion, while Allegra and the
colonel sailed east or west in the <i>Vendetta</i>. Her doctor would have
liked her to go with them, but she seemed to have an absolute aversion
to the sea, and he did not press the point.</p>

<p>"Nothing that she dislikes will do her any good," he told Colonel
Disney. "There is no use in being persistent about anything. Fancies
and whims stand for a great deal in such an illness as hers."</p>

<p>A week or two later the same kind doctor discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> his patient
was fast losing ground. Her strength had flagged considerably in a
short time. He recommended change of scene.</p>

<p>"This quiet life suited her wonderfully well for the first month or so,
but we are no longer making any headway. You had better try a gayer
place&mdash;a little more life and movement."</p>

<p>Martin Disney was ready to obey. He and Allegra took counsel together,
and then&mdash;in the lightest strain, one evening after dinner&mdash;they
discussed the notion of a change.</p>

<p>"Shall we strike our tents, Isola? Are you tired of San Remo?"</p>

<p>"No, Martin. I am tired of myself, sometimes&mdash;never of these olive
woods and lemon groves. Sometimes the stillness and the silent beauty
of the place make me feel unhappy, without knowing why; but that is a
kind of unhappiness no one can escape."</p>

<p>"Is there any place in the world within tolerable easy reach of this
that you would like to see?" asked her husband.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is one city in the world that I have been longing to see
ever since I began to have thoughts and wishes."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rome! I should like to see Rome before I die, Martin; if it were not
too troublesome for you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Troublesome! My dearest, can anything be troublesome to me if it
can but give you pleasure? You shall see Rome&mdash;not once&mdash;but again
and again, in the course of a long and happy life, I hope. I am more
than twenty years older than you; but I count upon at least thirty
years more upon this planet, before I blow out my candle and say '<i>Bon
soir</i>.'"</p>

<p>"God grant that you may live to a good old age, Martin. The world is
better for such a man as you."</p>

<p>"The world would be no place for me without my wife," he said. "And
so you would like to see Rome, Isa? What has put that fancy into your
head?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is an old dream, as I said just now. And lately I have been
talking to Father Rodwell, who knows Rome as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> well as if he were a
Roman citizen, and he has made me more and more anxious to go there. If
it would not be a great plague to you, Martin."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it would be a great pleasure. We will go to Rome,
Isa, if your doctor approve. Allegra will like it, I know."</p>

<p>"Like it?" echoed Allegra, "I shall simply be intoxicated with delight.
I know the catalogues of all the picture-galleries by heart. I think I
know every one of the seven hills as well as if I had walked upon them
from my childhood. I have read so many descriptions of the place and
its surroundings&mdash;so many raptures penned by people whom I have envied
for nothing else than that they have known Rome; they have lived in
Rome."</p>

<p>The whole business was easily settled. Captain Hulbert was the only
person who regretted the change. He had been a month at San Remo, a
month of summer idleness in February and March, a month of summer sails
on an azure sea; of mountain walks and rides, high up from stage to
stage, until the region of lemon groves and olive woods gave place to
the pines on the loftier hills. He had been able to spend all his days
in Allegra's society.</p>

<p>There were no pictures, except in that one little gallery at Colla.
There was nothing to distract her from her lover. In Rome there would
be all the wonders of the most wonderful city in the world. It would be
art first and love second.</p>

<p>The doctor approved; Father Rodwell wrote to an agent in Rome, and
after some negotiation a suite of apartments was found on the high
ground near the Trinità de' Monti, which seemed to meet all the
requirements of the case. The priest vouched for the honesty and good
faith of the agent, and on his responsibility the rooms were taken for
the month of April, with liberty to occupy them later if it were so
desired.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></p>

<p class="center">"THE WOODS ARE ROUND US, HEAPED AND DIM."</p>


<p>It was their last day at San Remo. Everything had been packed for the
journey, and the drawing-room at Lauter Brunnen had a dreary look now
that it was stripped of all those decorations and useful prettinesses
with which Allegra had made it so gay and home-like.</p>

<p>The morning was brilliant, and Martin, Allegra, and Captain Hulbert
set off at nine o'clock upon a long-deferred expedition to San Romolo.
They would be home in good time for the eight-o'clock dinner; and Isola
promised to amuse herself all day, and to be in good spirits to welcome
them on their return.</p>

<p>"You have a duty to do for your sister," she said, when her husband
felt compunction at leaving her. "Think of all she has done for us, her
devotion, her unselfishness. The least we can do is to help her to be
happy with her lover; and all the burden of that duty has fallen upon
you. I think you ought to be called Colonel Gooseberry."</p>

<p>She looked a bright and happy creature as she stood on the mule-path
in the olive wood, waving her hand to them as they went away&mdash;Allegra
riding a donkey, the two men walking, one on each side of her bridle,
and the guide striding on ahead, leading a second donkey which was to
serve as an occasional help by-and-by, if either of the pedestrians
wanted a lift. Her cheeks were flushed with walking, and her eyes were
bright with a new gladness.</p>

<p>She was full of a childish pleasure in the idea of their journey, and
the realization of a dream which most of us have dreamt a long time
before it assumed the shape of earthly things&mdash;the dream of Rome.</p>

<p>Isola stood listening to their footsteps, as they passed the little
painted shrine on the hill path. She heard them give the time of day
to a party of peasant women, with empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> baskets on their heads, going
up to gather the last of the olives. Then she roamed about the wooded
valley and the slope of the hill towards Colla for an hour or two, and
then, growing suddenly tired, she crept home, in time to sit beside her
baby while he slept his placid noontide sleep. She bent over the little
rosebud mouth and kissed it, in a rapture of maternal love.</p>

<p>"So young to see Rome," she murmured. "And to think that those
star-like eyes will see and take no heed; to think that such a glorious
vision will pass before him, and he will remember nothing."</p>

<p>The day was very long, something like one of those endless days at
Trelasco, when her husband was in Burmah and she had only the dog and
the cat for her companions. She thought of those fond friends to-day
with a regretful sigh&mdash;the sleepy Shah, so calm and undemonstrative in
his attachment, but with a placid, purring delight in her society which
seemed to mean a great deal; the fox-terrier, so active and intense in
his affection, demanding so much attention, intruding himself upon her
walks and reveries with such eager, not-to-be-denied devotion. She had
no four-footed friends here; and the want of them made an empty space
in her life.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the weather changed suddenly. The sky became overcast,
the sea a leaden colour; and the mistral came whistling up the valley
with a great rustling and shivering of the silver-green foliage and
creaking of the old bent branches, like the withered arms of witch or
sorceress. All the glory of the day was gone, and the white villas on
the crest of the eastward hill stood out in livid distinctness against
the blackened sky.</p>

<p>Isola wandered up the hill-path, past the little shrine where the way
divided, the point at which she had seen her husband and his party
vanish in the sunny morning. She felt a sudden sense of loneliness now
the sun was gone; a childish longing for the return of her friends,
for evening and lamplight, and the things that make for cheerfulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
She was cold and dull, and out of spirits. She had left the house
while the sun was shining, and she had come without shawl or wrap
of any kind, and the mistral made her shiver. Yet she had no idea
of hurrying home. The loneliness of the house had become oppressive
before she left it; and she knew there would be some hours to wait for
the return of the excursionists. So she mounted the steep mule-path,
slowly and painfully, till she had gone two-thirds of the way to Colla;
and then she sat down to rest on the low stone wall which enclosed a
little garden in a break of the wood, from which point there was a
far-stretching view seaward.</p>

<p>She was very cold, but she was so tired as to be glad to rest at any
hazard of after-suffering. Drowsy from sheer exhaustion, she leant
her head against a great rugged olive, whose roots were mixed up with
the wall, and fell fast asleep. She awoke, shivering, from a confused
dream of sea and woods, Roman temples and ruined palaces. She had
been wandering in one of those dream-cities that have neither limit
nor settled locality. It was here in the woods below Colla, and yet
was half Rome and half Trelasco. There was a classic temple upon a
hill that was like the Mount, and the day was bleak, and dark, and
rainy, and she was walking on the footpath through Lord Lostwithiel's
park, with the storm-driven rain beating against her face, just as on
that autumn evening, when the owner of the soil had taken compassion
upon her and had given her shelter. The dream had been curiously
vivid&mdash;a dream which brought the past back as if it were the present,
and blotted out all that had come afterwards. She woke bewildered,
forgetting that her husband had come back from India, and that she was
in Italy, thinking of herself as she had been that October evening when
she and Lostwithiel met for the first time.</p>

<p>Tho sea was darker than when she fell asleep. There was the dull
crimson of a stormy sunset yonder, behind the jutting promontory of
Bordighera, while the sky above was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> barred with long, black clouds,
and the wind was howling across the great deep valley like an evil
spirit tortured and imprisoned, shrieking to his gods for release.
Exactly opposite her, as she stood in the deep cleft of the hills,
a solitary vessel was labouring under press of canvas towards the
point upon whose dusky summit the chapel of the Madonna della Guardia
gleamed whitely in the dying day. The vessel was a schooner yacht, of
considerable tonnage, certainly larger than the <i>Vendetta</i>.</p>

<p>Isola stood, still as marble, watching that labouring boat, the
straining sails, the dark hull beaten by the stormy dash of the waves.
She watched with wide, open eyes, and parted lips, quivering as with an
over-mastering fear, watched in momentary expectation of seeing those
straining sails dip for the last time, that labouring hull founder and
vanish betwixt black wave and white surf. She watched in motionless
attention till the boat disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill;
and then, shivering, nervous, and altogether over-strung, she hurried
homewards, feeling that she had stayed out much too long, and that she
had caught a chill which might be the cause of new trouble.</p>

<p>If those narrow mule-paths had been less familiar, she might have lost
her way in the dusk; but she had trodden them too often to be in any
difficulty, and she reached the villa without loss of time, but not
before the return of the picnic party.</p>

<p>Allegra and Captain Hulbert were watching at the gate. Colonel Disney
had gone into the wood to look for her, and had naturally taken the
wrong direction.</p>

<p>"Oh, Isola; how could you stop out so late, and on such a stormy
evening?" remonstrated Allegra.</p>

<p>"I fell asleep before the storm came on."</p>

<p>"Fell asleep&mdash;out-of-doors&mdash;and at sunset! What dreadful imprudence."</p>

<p>"I went out too late, I'm afraid; but I was so tired of waiting for
you. A kind of horror of the house and the silence came upon me&mdash;and I
felt I must go out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> woods. I walked too far&mdash;and fell asleep
from sheer fatigue; and when I woke I saw a yacht fighting with the
wind. I'm afraid she'll go down."</p>

<p>"What, you noticed her too?" exclaimed Hulbert. "I didn't think you
cared enough about yachts to take notice of her. I was watching her
as we came down the hill; rather too much canvas; but she's right
enough. She's past Arma di Taggia by this time, I dare say. I'll go and
look for Disney, and tell him you're safe and sound. Perhaps I shall
miss him in the wood. It's like a Midsummer Night's Dream, isn't it,
Allegra?" he said, laughing, as he went out of the gate.</p>

<p>"If it were only mid-summer, I shouldn't care," answered his
sweetheart, with her arm round Isola, who stood beside her, pale and
shivering. "Come in, dear, and let me make you warm, if I can."</p>

<p>"If they should all go down in the darkness!" said Isola, in a low,
dreamy voice. "The boat looked as if it might be wrecked at any moment."</p>

<p>Allegra employed all her arts as a sick-nurse in the endeavour to ward
off any evil consequence from that imprudent slumber in the chill
hour of sunset; but her cares were unavailing. Isola was restless and
feverish all night, yet she insisted on getting up at her usual hour
next morning, and declared herself quite capable of the journey to
Genoa. Allegra and her brother, however, insisted on her resting for a
day or two. So the departure was postponed, and the doctor sent for.
He advised at least three days' rest, with careful nursing; and he
reproved his patient severely for her imprudence in exposing herself to
the evening air.</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert appeared at teatime, just returned from a railway
journey to Allassio.</p>

<p>"I've a surprise for you, Mrs. Disney," he said, seating himself by
the sofa where Isola was lying, surrounded by invalid luxuries, books,
lemonade, fan, and eau de Cologne flask, her feet covered with a silken
rug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"A surprise!" she echoed faintly, as if life held no surprises for her.
"What can that be?"</p>

<p>"You remember the yacht you saw last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried, roused in an instant, and clasping her hands
excitedly. "Did she go down?"</p>

<p>"Not the least little bit. She is safe and sound at Allassio. She is
called the <i>Eurydice</i>, she hails last from Syracuse, and my brother
is on board her. He wired to me this morning to go over and see him.
I'm very glad I went, for he is off to Corfu to-morrow. The <i>Flying
Dutchman</i> isn't in it with him."</p>

<p>There was a curious silence. Martin Disney was sitting on the other
side of his wife's sofa, where he had been reading selected bits
of the <i>Times</i>, such portions of the news of men and nations as he
fancied might interest her. Allegra was busy with a piece of delicate
needlework, and did not immediately reply; but it was she who was first
to speak.</p>

<p>"How frightened you would have been yesterday evening had you known who
was on board the boat," she said.</p>

<p>"I don't know about being frightened, but he was certainly carrying too
much canvas. I told him so this morning."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Laughed at me. 'You sailors never believe that a landsman can sail a
ship,' he said. I wanted to talk to his sailing-master, but he told me
he was his own sailing-master. If his ship was doomed to go down, he
meant to be at the helm himself."</p>

<p>"That sounds as if he were foolhardy," said Allegra.</p>

<p>"I told him I did not like the rig of his boat, nor the name of his
boat, and I reminded him how I saw the <i>Eurydice</i> off Portland with
all her canvas spread the day she went down. I was with the Governor
of the Prison, a naval man, who had been commander on my first ship,
and we stood side by side on the cliff, and watched her as she went
by. 'If this wind gets much stronger, that ship will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> go down,' said
my old captain, 'unless they take in some of their canvas.' And a few
hours later these poor fellows had all gone to the bottom. I asked
Lostwithiel why he called his boat the <i>Eurydice</i>. 'Fancy,' he said; he
had a fancy for the name. 'I've never forgotten the old lines we used
to hammer out when we were boys,' he said&mdash;'Ah, miseram, Eurydicen!
anima fugiente vocabat; Eurydicen toto referebant flumine ripæ.'"</p>

<p>"I don't think the name matters, if she is a good boat," said Allegra,
with her calm common sense.</p>

<p>"Well, she is, and she isn't. She is a finer boat than the <i>Vendetta</i>;
but I'd sooner handle the <i>Vendetta</i> in a storm. There are points about
his new boat that I don't quite like. However, he had her built by one
of the finest builders on the Clyde, and it will be hard if she goes
wrong. He has given me the <i>Vendetta</i> as a wedding-present&mdash;in advance
of the event&mdash;on condition that I sink her when I'm tired of her; and
he said he hoped she'd be luckier to me than she had been to him."</p>

<p>Martin Disney sat silent by his wife's sofa. He could never hear
Lord Lostwithiel's name without a touch of pain. His only objection
to Hulbert as a brother-in-law was the thought that the two men were
of the same race&mdash;that he must needs hear the hated name from time
to time; and yet he believed his wife's avowal that she was pure and
true. His hatred of the name came only from the recollection that she
had been slandered by a man whom he despised. He looked at the wasted
profile on the satin pillow, so wan, so transparent in its waxen
pallor, the heavy eyelid drooping languidly, the faintly coloured
lips drawn as if with pain&mdash;a broken lily. Was this the kind of woman
to be suspected of evil&mdash;this fair and fragile creature, in whom the
spiritual so predominated over the sensual? He hated himself for having
been for a moment influenced by that underbred scoundrel at Glenaveril,
for having been base enough to doubt his wife's purity.</p>

<p>He had pained and humiliated her, and now the stamp of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> death was on
the face he adored, and before him lay the prospect of a life's remorse.</p>

<p>They left San Remo three days afterwards, Isola being pronounced able
to bear the journey, though her cough had been considerably increased
by that imprudent slumber in the wood. She was anxious to go; and
doctor and husband gave way to her eagerness for new scenes.</p>

<p>"I am so tired of this place," she said piteously. "It is lovely; but
it is a loveliness that makes me melancholy. I want to be in a great
city where there are lots of people moving about. I have never lived in
a city, but always in quiet places&mdash;beautiful, very beautiful, but so
still&mdash;so still&mdash;so full of one's self and one's own thoughts."</p>

<p class="center">ECCO ROMA.</p>


<p>The agent had proved himself worthy of trust, and had chosen the
lodging for Colonel Disney's family with taste and discretion. It was a
first floor over a jeweller's shop in a short street behind the Piazza
di Spagna, and under the Pincian Gardens. There were not too many
stairs for Isola to ascend when she came in from her drive or walk.
The gardens were close at hand, and all around there were trees and
flowers, and an atmosphere of verdure and retirement in the midst of
the great cosmopolitan city.</p>

<p>It was dark when the train came into the terminus; and Isola was weary
and exhausted after the long hot journey from Pisa, the glare of the
sun, and the suffocating clouds of dust, and the beautiful monotony
of blue sea and sandy plains, long level wastes, where nothing grew
but brushwood and osier, and stretches of marshy ground, with water
pools shining here and there, like burnished steel, and distant islets
dimly seen athwart a cloud of heat. Then evening closed in, and it was
through a grey and formless world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> that they approached the city whose
very name thrilled her.</p>

<p>The railway station was very much like any other great terminus; like
Milan, like Genoa. There was the same close rank of omnibuses. There
were the same blue blouses and civil, eager porters, far too few for
the work to be done, rapacious but amiable, piling up the innumerable
packages of the Italian traveller, loading themselves like so many
human beasts of burden, and with no apparent limit to their capacity
for carrying things. Two flys were packed with the miscellaneous
luggage, nurse and baby, and then Isola was handed to her place in
another, with Allegra by her side, and through the narrow streets of
tall houses, under the dim strip of soft April night, she drove through
the city of heroes and martyrs, saints and apostles, wicked emperors
and holy women, the city of historical contrasts, of darkness and
light, refinement and barbarism, of all things most unlike each other,
from Nero to Paul, from Gregory the Great to the Borgias.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The glory and the beauty of Rome only began to dawn upon her next
morning, in the vivid sunlight, when she climbed the steps of the
Trinità de' Monti, and then with Allegra's arm to lean upon went slowly
upward and again upward to the topmost terrace on the Pincian Hill,
and stood leaning on the marble balustrade, and gazing across the city
that lay steeped in sunshine at her feet&mdash;over palace and steeple,
pinnacle and tower, to the rugged grandeur of Hadrian's Tomb, and to
that great dome whose vastness makes all other temples seem puny and
insignificant. This was her first view of the world's greatest church.</p>

<p>The air was clear and cool upon this height, although the city below
showed dimly through a hazy veil of almost tropical heat. Everywhere
there was the odour of summer flowers, the overpowering sweetness of
lilies of the valley, and great branches of lilac, white and purple,
brimming over in the baskets of the flower-sellers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>On such a morning as this one could understand how the Romans came to
call April the joyous month, and to dedicate this season of sunshine
and flowers to the Goddess of Beauty and Love.</p>

<p>Isola's face lighted up with a new gladness, a look of perfect
absorption and self-forgetfulness, as she leant upon the balustrade,
and gazed across that vast panorama, gazed and wondered, with eyes that
seemed to grow larger in their delight.</p>

<p>"And is this really Rome?" she murmured softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is Rome," cried Allegra. "Isn't it lovely? Isn't it all
you ever dreamt of or hoped for? And yet people have so maligned
it&mdash;called it feverish, stuffy, disappointing, dirty! Why, the air is
ether&mdash;inspiring, health-giving! April in Rome is as fresh as April
in an English forest; only it is April with the warmth and flowers of
June. I feel sure you will grow ever so much stronger after one little
week in Rome."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know I shall be better here. I feel better already," said
Isola, with a kind of feverish hopefulness. "It was so good of Martin
to bring me. San Remo is always lovely&mdash;and I shall love it to the end
of my life, because it was my first home in Italy&mdash;but I was beginning
to be tired&mdash;not of the olive woods and the sea, but of the people we
met, and the sameness of life. One day was so like another."</p>

<p>"It was monotonous, of course," agreed Allegra; "and being a little
out of health, you would be bored by monotony sooner than Martin or I.
It was such a pity you did not like the yacht. That made such a change
for us. The very olive woods and the mountain villages seem new when
one sees them from the water. I was never tired of looking at the hills
between San Remo and Bordighera, or the promontory of Monaco, with its
cathedral towers. It was a pleasure lost to you, dear; but it could not
be helped, I suppose. Yet once upon a time you used to be so fond of
the sea, when you and I went in our row-boat, tempting danger round by
Neptune Point."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"I may have been stronger then," Isola faltered.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me, darling! What an inconsiderate wretch I am! But Rome
will give you back your lost strength; and we shall round Neptune Point
again, and feel the salt spray dashing over our heads as we go out into
the great fierce Atlantic. I confess that sometimes, when that divine
Mediterranean which we are never tired of worshipping has been lying in
the sunshine like one vast floor of <i>lapis lazuli</i>, I have longed for
something rougher and wilder&mdash;for such a sea as you and I have watched
from the Rashleigh Mausoleum."</p>

<p>Colonel Disney and his wife and sister went about in a very leisurely
way in their explorations. In the first place, he was anxious to avoid
anything approaching fatigue for his wife; and in the second place
it was only the beginning of April, and they were to be in Rome for
at least a month; there was therefore no need for rushing hither and
thither at the tourist pace, with guide-books in their hands, and
anxious, heated countenances, perspiring through the streets, and
suffering deadly chills in the churches. Allegra's first desire was
naturally to see the picture-galleries, and to these she went for the
most part alone, leaving Isola and her husband free to wander about
as they pleased, upon a friendly equality of ignorance, knowing very
little more than Childe Harold and Murray could teach them. Isola's
Rome was Byron's Rome.</p>

<p>There was one spot she loved better than any other in the city of
mighty memories. It was not hallowed by the blood of saint or hero,
sage or martyr. It had no classical associations. He whose heart
lay buried there under the shadow of the tribune's mighty monument,
perished in the pride of manhood, in the freshness and glory of life;
and that heart&mdash;so warm and generous to his fellow-men&mdash;had hardened
itself against the God of saint and martyr, the God of Peter and Paul,
Lawrence and Gregory, Benedict and Augustine. Yet for Isola there was
no grave in Rome so fraught with spiritual thoughts as Shelley's grave,
no sweeter memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> associated with the eternal city than the memory of
his wanderings and meditations amidst the ruined walls of the Baths of
Caracalla, where his young genius drank in the poetry of the long past,
and fed upon the story of the antique dead.</p>

<p>She came to Shelley's grave as often as she could steal away from the
anxious companions of her drives and walks.</p>

<p>"I like to be alone now and then," she told her husband. "It rests me
to sit by myself for an hour or two in this lovely place."</p>

<p>There was a coachman in the Piazza who was in the habit of driving
Colonel Disney's family&mdash;an elderly man, sober, steady and attentive,
with intelligence that made him almost as good as a guide. He was
on the watch for his English clients every morning. They had but to
appear on the Piazza, and he was in attendance, ready to take them to
the utmost limit of a day's journey, if they liked. Were they in doubt
where to go, he was always prompt with suggestions.</p>

<p>He would drive Isola to the door of the English cemetery, leave her
there, and return at her bidding to take her home again. Disney knew
she was safe when this veteran had her in charge. The man was well
known in the Piazza, and of established character for honesty. She
took a book or two in her light basket, buying a handful of flowers
here and there from the women and children as she went along, till the
books were hidden under roses and lilac. Tho custodian of the cemetery
knew her, and admitted her without a word. He had watched her furtively
once or twice, to see that she neither gathered the flowers nor tried
to scratch her name upon the tombs. He had seen her sitting quietly by
the slab which records Shelley's death&mdash;and the death of that faithful
friend who was laid beside him, sixty years afterwards. Sixty years
of loving, regretful memory, and then union in the dust. Shall there
not be a later and a better meeting, when those two shall see each
other's faces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> hear each other's voices again, in a world where old
things shall be made new, where youth and its wild freshness shall come
back again, and Trelawney shall be as young in thought and feeling as
Shelley?</p>

<p>The English burial-place was a garden of fairest flowers at this
season&mdash;a paradise of roses and clematis, azaleas and camelias&mdash;and
much more beautiful for its wilder growth of trailing foliage and
untended shrubs, the pale cold blue of the periwinkle that carpeted
slope and bank, and for the background of old grey wall, severe in its
antique magnificence, a cyclopean rampart, relic of time immemorial,
clothed and beautified with weed and floweret that grew in every cleft
and cranny.</p>

<p>Here, in a sheltered angle to the left of the poet's grave, Isola could
sit unobserved, even when the custodian brought a party of tourists to
see the hallowed spot, which occurred now and then while she sat there.
The tourists for the most part stared foolishly, made some sentimental
remark if they were women, or if they were men, betrayed a hopeless
ignorance of the poet's history, and not unfrequently confounded him
with Keats. Isola sat half-hidden in her leafy corner, where the ivy
and the acanthus hung from the great grey buttress against which she
leant, languid, half-dreaming, with two books on her lap.</p>

<p>One was her Shelley&mdash;her much-read Shelley&mdash;a shabby, cloth-bound
volume, bought in her girlhood at the book-seller's in the Place
Duguesclin, where English books could be got by special order, and at
special prices. The other was an Italian Testament, which her husband
had bought her at San Remo, and in which she had read with extreme
diligence and with increasing fervour as her mind became more deeply
moved by Father Rodwell's sermons. It was not that she had ever been
one of those advanced thinkers who will accept no creed which does not
square with their own little theories and fit in to their own narrow
circle of possibilities. She had never doubted the creed she had been
taught in her childhood, but she had thought very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> little about serious
things, since she was a young girl, preparing for her confirmation,
touched with girlish enthusiasm, and very much in earnest. In these
fair spring days, and in this city of many memories, all young thoughts
had reawakened in her mind. She pored over the familiar Gospel-stories,
and again, as in the first freshness of her girlhood, she saw the
sacred figure of the Redeemer and Teacher in all the vivid light and
colour of a reality, close at hand. Faith stretched a hand across the
abyss of time, and brought the old world of the Gospel-story close to
her; the closer, because she was in Rome, not far from that church
which enshrines the print of the Divine footstep, when He who was God
and Man, appeared to His disciple, to foreshadow approaching martyrdom,
to inspire the fortitude of the martyr. Yes, although the Saviour's
earthly feet never entered the city, every hill and every valley within
and without those crumbling walls has interwoven itself so closely with
the story of His life&mdash;through the work of His saints and martyrs&mdash;that
it is nowise strange if the scenes and images of the sacred story seem
nearer and more vivid in Rome than in any other place on earth, not
excepting Jerusalem. It was from Rome, not from Jerusalem, that the
Cross went out to the uttermost ends of the world. It is the earth of
the Colosseum and the Borgo that is steeped in the blood of those who
have died for Christ. It was Rome that ruled the world, through the
long night of barbarism and feudal power, by the invincible force of
His name.</p>

<p>It might seem strange that Isola should turn from the story of the
Evangelists to the works of a poet whose human sympathies were so
wrung by the evil that has been wrought in the name of the Cross that
he was blind to the infinitely greater good which Christianity has
accomplished for mankind. Shelley saw the blood of the martyrs, not as
a sublime testimony to the Godlike power of faith, not as a sacrifice
rich in after-fruits, sad seed of a joyous harvest&mdash;but as the brutal
outcome of man's cruelty, using any name, Christ, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> Buddha, Mahomet,
or Brahma&mdash;as the badge of tyranny, the sanction to torture and to slay.</p>

<p>Shelley's melancholy fate seemed brought nearer to her now that she
sat beside his grave, in the summer stillness, and in the shadow of
the old Aurelian Wall. It was only his heart that was lying there,
the imperishable heart, snatched by Trelawney's hand from the flame
of the Greek pyre, from the smoke of pine-logs and frankincense, wine
and oil. Sixty years had passed before that hand lay cold in the grave
beside the buried heart of the poet, sixty years of severance, and fond
faithful memory, before death brought re-union.</p>

<p>What a beautiful spirit this, which was so early quenched by the
cruelest stroke of Fate&mdash;a light such as seldom shone out of mortal
clay, a spirit of fire and brightness, intangible, untamable, not to be
shut within common limits, nor judged by common laws!</p>

<p class="center">"SEEK SHELTER IN THE SHADOW OF THE TOMB."</p>


<p>Of the people who came to look upon the grave, some to lay a tributary
flower upon the stone, and some to pluck a leaf or two of acanthus
or violet, all hitherto had been strangers to Isola, had gone away
without seeing her, or had glanced indifferently, as at one more
unfortunate with a sketching-block, spoiling paper in the pursuit of
the unattainable. There were so many amateur artists sitting about
in the outskirts of the city, that such a figure in a romantic spot
challenged nobody's attention. So far people had come and gone, and had
taken no notice; but one afternoon a figure in a long black cassock
came suddenly between her and the golden light, and Isola looked up
with a cry of surprise on recognizing Father Rodwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"You did not expect to see me here," he said, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>She had risen from her seat on the low grassy bank, and she gave him
her hand, half in pleasure, half in a nervous apprehension which his
keen eye was quick to perceive. His life had been spent in dealings
with the souls of men and women, and he had learnt to read those living
pages as easily as he read Plato or Spinosa.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I had no idea you were in Rome. You told us you were
going back to London."</p>

<p>"I meant to go back to London and hard work, but my doctor insisted
upon my prolonging my holiday for a few weeks, so I came here instead.
Rome always draws me, and is always new. Rome gives me fresh life and
fresh power when my heart and brain have been feeling benumbed and
dead. I am glad they brought you here, Mrs. Disney. You were looking
languid and ill when you left San Remo. I hope Rome has revivified you."</p>

<p>He looked at her earnestly. Her face had been in shadow until now, but
as she moved into the sunlight, he saw that the lines had sharpened in
the pale, wan face, and that there was the stamp of wasting disease
in the hollow cheeks, and about the sunken eyes, and in the almost
bloodless lips. As he looked at her in friendliest commiseration
those pathetic grey eyes&mdash;whose expression had baffled his power of
interpretation hitherto&mdash;filled suddenly with tears, and in the next
moment she clasped her hands before her face in an agony of grief.</p>

<p>The Italian Testament which she had been reading when he approached
dropped at her feet, and stooping to pick it up Father Rodwell saw that
it was open at the fourth chapter of St. John, the story of the woman
of Samaria, the sinner with whom Christ talked at the well. A leaf
from Shelley's grave lay upon the book, as if to mark where Isola had
been reading, and Father Rodwell's quick glance saw that the page was
blotted with tears.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Disney," he said gently, "is there anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> wrong at
home? Your husband, your boy are well, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank God, they are both well. God has been very good to me. He
might have taken those I love. He has been merciful."</p>

<p>"He is merciful to all His creatures; though there are times when His
dealings with us seem very hard. Oh, Mrs. Disney, you can't think how
difficult a priest's office is sometimes when he has to reconcile the
afflicted with the Providence that has seen fit to lay some heavy
burden on them. They cannot understand; they cannot say it is well.
They cannot kiss the rod. But as you say, God has been good to you.
Your lines have been set in pleasant places. You are hedged round and
sheltered by love. I never saw greater affection in husband for wife
than I have seen in your husband. I never saw sister more devoted to
sister than your sister-in-law is to you."</p>

<p>She had sunk again into a sitting position on the low bank at the foot
of the wall. Her face was still hidden, and her sobs came faster as he
spoke to her.</p>

<p>"Why should you grieve at the thought of their love? Is it because it
may please God to take you from them in the morning of your life? If it
is that dread which agitates you I entreat you to put it aside. There
is nothing in your case that forbids hope, and hope will do much to
help your recovery. You should tell yourself how valuable your life is
to those who love you. The thought of their affection should give you
courage to struggle against apathy and languor. Believe me, invalids
have their condition a great deal more in their own power than they
are inclined to believe. So much can be overcome where the spirit is
strong and brave, where faith and hope fight against bodily weakness.
You ought not to be sitting alone here in this saddening spot. It is
lovely, but with the beauty of death. You ought to be driving out to
Frascati or to Tivoli with your husband. You ought to be watching the
carriages in the Pincian Gardens, or amusing yourself in one of the
picture galleries."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had rather be alone," she said, wiping away her tears, and in some
degree recovering her self-possession.</p>

<p>"That is a morbid fancy, and one that hinders your recovery."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to recover. I only want to die."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Disney, it is your duty to fight against these melancholy
moods. Can you be indifferent to your husband's feelings? Have you not
the mother's natural desire to watch over your child's early years, to
see him reach manhood?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" she cried passionately. "I have had enough of life. They
are dear to me, very dear. No wife ever loved and honoured her husband
more than I love and honour mine&mdash;but it is all over, it is past, and
ended. I am more than resigned to death&mdash;I am thankful that God has
called me away."</p>

<p>He watched her closely as she spoke, watched her with his hand upon
hers, which was cold as ice. He had heard such words before from the
early doomed, but they had been accompanied by religious exaltation;
they had been the outpouring of a faith that saw the gates of heaven
opened and the Son of man sitting in glory&mdash;of a love that longed to be
with God. Here there was no sign of hope or exaltation. There were only
the tokens of despair.</p>

<p>He remembered how agitated he had seen her many times in the
little church at San Remo, and how, although hanging eagerly upon
his preaching, she had persistently avoided anything like serious
conversation with him upon the few occasions when he had found himself
alone with her.</p>

<p>He had her Testament still in his hand, and looking down at the
tear-stained page it seemed to him that there lay the clue to her
melancholy.</p>

<p>"You have been reading the story of the woman of Samaria," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have read that other story of her who knelt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> the dust at
her Saviour's feet, and to whom He said, 'Neither do I condemn thee.'"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is there anything in either of those stories to sadden you more than
the thought of sin and sorrow saddens all of us?"</p>

<p>She looked at him shrinkingly, pale as death, as if he had a dagger in
his hand ready to strike her.</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose there is anything that goes home to my heart any
more than to other hearts," she said, after a pause, trying to speak
carelessly. "We are all sinners. The Gospel teaches us that in every
line! We are none of us altogether worthy&mdash;not even my husband, I
suppose, although to me he seems a perfect Christian."</p>

<p>"I can believe that he is a Christian, Mrs. Disney, and a man of strong
convictions. If he had wronged anybody, I do not think he would rest
till he had atoned for that wrong."</p>

<p>"I am sure he would not. He would do his uttermost to atone. And so
would I&mdash;although I do not pretend to be half so good a Christian as he
is. I would do all in my power to atone for any wrong I had done to one
I loved."</p>

<p>"As you love your husband, for instance."</p>

<p>"Yes, as I love him. He is first in the world for me. Dear as my child
is, Martin must always be first."</p>

<p>"And you would not for the world do him any wrong?" pursued the priest,
more and more earnest as he went on, pale with emotion, his whole power
of observation concentrated upon the whitening face and lowered eyelids
of the woman sitting at his feet.</p>

<p>"Not for the world, not for my life," she said, with her hands tightly
clasped, her eyes still hidden under the heavy lids, tearless now&mdash;and
with dry and quivering lips, from which the words came with a dull and
soulless sound. "I would die to save him an hour's pain. I would fling
away this wretched life rather than grieve him for a moment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor soul!" murmured the priest, pitying that debt of self-abasement
which he understood so well, under whatsoever guise she might hide her
contrition. "Poor soul, you talk too lightly of that great mystery
which we should all face in a spirit of deep humility. Do you feel
that you can contemplate that passage through death to a new life
without fear of the issue? Have you no reckoning to make with the God
who pardons repentant sinners? Do you stand before Him with a clear
conscience&mdash;having kept nothing back&mdash;cherished no hidden sin?"</p>

<p>"No one can be without sin in His sight. Do you suppose that I am
sinless, or that I have ever believed myself sinless? I know how
weak and poor a thing I am&mdash;a worm in the sight of Him who rules the
universe. But if&mdash;if He cares for such as I, He knows that I am sorry
for every sinful thought and every sinful act of my life."</p>

<p>She spoke in short sentences, each phrase broken by a sob. She felt
as if he were tearing out her heart, this man who had been heretofore
so kindly and indulgent in his speech and manner that he seemed to
make religion an easy thing, a garment as loose and expansive as
philosophy itself. And, now, all at once he appeared before her as a
judge, searching out her heart, cruel, inflexible, weighing her in the
balance, and finding her wanting.</p>

<p>"If I am sorry," she murmured, between her sobs, "what more can God or
man require of me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, if your sorrow is that true sorrow which means repentance,
and goes hand-in-hand with atonement. Forgive me, my dear friend,
for presuming to speak unreservedly to you. If I try to find out the
nature of your wound it is only that I may help you to heal it. Ever
since I have known you I have seen the tokens of a wounded heart, a
bruised and broken spirit. I saw you surrounded with all the blessings
that make woman's lot happy. It was hardly possible to conceive
fairer surroundings and truer friends. Can you wonder, then, if my
compassionate interest was awakened by the indications of a deep-rooted
sorrow for which there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> no apparent cause? I saw your emotion in
church, saw how quickly your heart and mind responded to the appeal
of religion&mdash;saw in you a soul attuned to heavenly things, and day by
day my interest in you and yours grew stronger. The hope of seeing you
again, of helping you to bear your burden, of ultimately lightening
it, was one of my reasons for coming to Rome. I felt somehow that you
and I had not met in vain&mdash;that my power to move you was not without a
meaning in both our lives; that if, as I thought, you needed spiritual
help and comfort, it was my vocation to help and comfort you. And so
I came to Rome, and so I found out where you spent your quiet hours,
and so I have followed you here this afternoon. Tell me, Mrs. Disney,
did I presume too much? Was it the preacher's vanity or the priest's
intuition that spoke?"</p>

<p>"It was intuition," she said. "You saw that I had sinned. None but a
sinner could shed such tears&mdash;could so feel the terror of God's wrath."</p>

<p>"It is of His love I want you to think. Of His immeasurable love and
pity. Of His Son's Divine compassion. If you have any special need of
His pardon; if there is any sinful secret locked in your heart; do not
let the golden hours go by&mdash;the time meet for repentance."</p>

<p>"I have repented," she cried piteously. "My life has been one long
repentance ever since my sin."</p>

<p>"And your husband&mdash;he who so fondly loves you&mdash;he knows all, and has
forgiven all?"</p>

<p>"Knows!" The word broke from her lips almost in a shriek of horror.
"He knows nothing&mdash;he must never know. He would despise me, leave me
to die alone, while he went far away from me, to the very end of the
world. He would take his son with him. I should be left alone&mdash;alone to
face death&mdash;the most desolate creature God ever looked upon. Oh, Father
Rodwell, why have you wrung my secret from me?" she cried, grovelling
on her knees in the long grass beside him, clinging to his hand as he
bent over her, gravely compassionate, deeply moved by her distress.
"How cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> to question&mdash;to torture me&mdash;how cruel to use your power
of reading guilty hearts. You will tell my husband, who so loves and
trusts me. You will tell him what a guilty wretch I am."</p>

<p>"Tell him, Mrs. Disney! Can you forget that I am a priest&mdash;for whom the
sinner's confession is sacred? Do you think I have never talked with
the tempted and the sorrowing before to-day? Do you think that grief
such as yours can be an unknown experience to a man who has worked
in a crowded London parish for nearly twenty years? I wanted to know
the worst, so that I might be able to advise and to console you. If I
have questioned you to-day, it has been as a priest has the right to
question; and this place where you and I have met to-day is in my sight
as sacred as the confessional. You need have no fear that I shall tell
your husband the secret of your sorrow. All I will do is to help you to
find strength to tell him yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, no!" she cried piteously. "Never! never! I can die, I am
prepared to die; but I can never tell him&mdash;I cannot, I dare not."</p>

<p>"Yet you could dare to die with a lie upon your lips&mdash;you who are
ready to meet your Judge&mdash;you whose whole life is a lie&mdash;you who have
cheated and betrayed the best of men. Oh, Mrs. Disney, reflect what
this thing is which you are doing; reflect what kind of sin it is you
are committing. If, as your own sorrowing words acknowledge, you have
been a false wife&mdash;a false wife to the best and truest of husbands, can
you dare to act out that falsehood to the last, to die with that guilty
secret locked in your heart, from him who has a right to know,&mdash;and who
alone upon earth has a right to pardon."</p>

<p>"Oh, how cruel you are!" she said, lifting up her streaming eyes to his
earnest, inflexible face. "Is it a Christian's part to be so cruel,
to break the bruised reed, to crush anything so weak and wretched as
I am? Is not repentance enough? I have spent long nights in penitence
and tears, long days in dull aching remorse. I would have given all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> my
future life to atone for one dreadful hour&mdash;one unpremeditated yielding
to temptation. I <i>have</i> given my life&mdash;for my secret has killed me.
What more can man or God demand of me? What more can I do to win
forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"Only this&mdash;tell your husband the truth&mdash;however painful, however
humiliating the confession. That will be your best atonement. That
is the sacrifice which will help to reconcile you with your God. You
cannot hope for God's love and pardon hereafter, if you live and die
as a hypocrite here. God's saints were some of them steeped in the
darkness of guilt before they became the children of light&mdash;but there
was not one of them who shrank from the confession of his sins."</p>

<p>"You are a man," sobbed Isola. "You do not know what it is for a woman
to confess that she is unworthy of her husband's love. You do not know.
It is not possible for a man to know the meaning of shame."</p>

<p>"You are wrong there," he said, gently lifting her from the ground,
and placing her beside him on the bank. "What chastity is to a woman,
honour is to a man. Men have had to stand up before their fellow-men
and acknowledge their violation of man's code of honour; knowing that
such acknowledgment made them dirt, and very dirt, in the sight of
honourable men. You, as a woman, know not how deep men's scorn cuts a
man who has sinned against the law which governs gentlemen. A woman
thinks there is no such sting as the sting of her shame. Men know
better. Yes, I know that it will be most bitter, more bitter than
death&mdash;for you to tell Colonel Disney that you are not what you have
seemed to him; but apart from all considerations of duty, do not his
love and devotion deserve the sacrifice of self-love on your part?
Can you bear yourself to the last, as a virtuous wife&mdash;enjoying his
respect&mdash;knowing that it is undeserved&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will tell him&mdash;at the last," she faltered. "In that parting hour I
shall not shrink from telling him all&mdash;how I sinned against him&mdash;almost
unawares&mdash;drifting half unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> into a fatal entanglement&mdash;and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;against my will&mdash;in my weakness and helplessness&mdash;alone
in the power of the man I loved&mdash;betrayed into sin. Oh God! why do
you make me remember?" she cried wildly, turning upon the priest
in passionate reproachfulness. "For years I have been trying to
forget&mdash;trying to blank out the past&mdash;praying, praying, praying that
my humble, tearful love for my husband and my child might cancel those
hours of sin. And you come to me, and question me, and on pretence of
saving my soul, you force me to look back upon that bygone horror&mdash;to
live again through that time of madness&mdash;the destruction of my life.
Cruel, cruel, cruel!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" said Father Rodwell, very gently, seeing that she was
struggling with hysteria. "I have been too hard, perhaps, too eager
to convince you of the right! There are some men, even of my sacred
calling, who would judge your case otherwise&mdash;who would say the husband
is happy in his ignorance; the wife has repented of her sin. <i>Non
quieta movere.</i> But it is not in my nature to choose the easy pathways;
and it may be that I am too severe a teacher. We will not talk any more
about serious things to-day. Only believe that I am your friend&mdash;your
sincere and devoted friend. If I have spoken hard things, be assured I
would have spoken in the same spirit had you been my own sister. Let
us say no more yet awhile&mdash;and perhaps when you have thought over our
interview to-day you will come to see things almost as I see them. I
won't press the matter. I will leave your own heart and conscience to
plead with you. And now may I walk home with you, before the beauty of
the afternoon begins to fade?"</p>

<p>"The vetturino will be waiting for me at the gate," Isola answered,
with a dull, dead voice, rising languidly, and adjusting the loosened
hair about her forehead with tremulous fingers.</p>

<p>She had thrown off her hat a little while before, and now she took it
up, and straightened the loops of ribbon with a nervous touch here and
there, and then put the hat on again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> and arranged the gossamer veil,
which she hoped might hide her swollen eyelids and tear-stained cheeks.</p>

<p>"If Martin should come to meet me, what will he think? she said
piteously.</p>

<p>"Let me go with you, and I may be able to distract his attention&mdash;if
you don't want him to see that you have been crying."</p>

<p>"No, no. He must not see. He would wonder, and question me&mdash;and guess,
perhaps&mdash;as you did just now. How was it you knew&mdash;what made you
guess?" she asked, with a sense of rebellion against this man who had
pierced the veil behind which she had been hiding herself so long.</p>

<p>"I saw your sorrow; and I knew that there could scarcely be so deep a
sorrow if there were no memory of sin. Will you take my arm down this
steep path?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I know every step. I could walk about this place in my
sleep. You have been cruel to me, Father Rodwell, very cruel. Promise
me one thing by way of atonement for your cruelty. Promise me that if
I die in Rome I shall be buried in this place, and as near Shelley's
grave as they can find room to lay me."</p>

<p>"I promise. Yes, it is a sweet spot, is it not? It was down yonder in
the old burial-ground that Shelley looked upon the grave of Keats, and
said it was a spot to make one in love with death. But I would not
have you think yourself doomed to an early death, Mrs. Disney. Have
you never read in the 'Lives of the Saints' how some who were on the
point of death have revived at the touch of the holy oil, and have
lived and have renewed their strength, and re-entered the world to
lead a holier and nobler life than they had led before? Who knows if
you were to confess your sin, and patiently suffer whatever penance
you were called upon to bear, new vistas might not open for you? There
is more than one way of being happy in this world. If you could never
again know the sweetness of a domestic life&mdash;as trusted wife and happy
mother&mdash;there are other and wider lives in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> which you would count your
children and your sisters by hundreds. There are sisterhoods in which
your future might be full of usefulness and full of peace. Or if you
had no vocation for that wider life, it might be that touched by your
helplessness in the past, and your remorse in the present, your husband
might find it in his heart to forgive that bygone sin, and still to
cherish, and still to hold you dear."</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried impatiently. "I would not live for an hour after he
knew. I know what he would do. He has told me. He would leave me&mdash;at
once, and for ever. I should never see his face again. I should be dead
to him, by a worse death than the grave; for he would only think of me
to shudder at my name. Oh, Father Rodwell, Christianity must be a cruel
creed if it can demand such a sacrifice from me. What good can come of
his knowing the truth? Only agony to him and shame and despair to me.
Can that be good?"</p>

<p>"Truth is life, and falsehood is death," answered the priest, firmly.
"You must choose your own course, Mrs. Disney; but there is one
argument I may urge as a man of the world rather than as a priest.
Nothing is ever hidden for very long in this life. There is no secret
so closely kept that some one has not an inkling of it. Better your
husband should hear the truth from you, in humble self-accusation, than
that he should learn it later&mdash;perhaps after he has mourned you for
years&mdash;from a stranger's lips."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be horrible&mdash;too horrible. But I will confess to him;
I will tell him everything&mdash;on my deathbed. Yes, when life is ebbing,
when the end is close, I will tell him. He shall know what a false and
perjured creature I am. I swore to him&mdash;swore before God that I was
true and faithful&mdash;that I loved him and no other. And it was true,
absolute truth, when I took that oath. My sin was a thing of the past.
I had loved another, and I had let my love lead me into sin. And then
my husband asked me if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> I had been true and pure always; always. 'Is
that true, Isola? I call upon God to hear your answer,' he said. And
I answered yes, it was true. I lied before God rather than lose my
husband's love; and God heard me, and the blight of His anger has been
upon me ever since, withering and consuming me."</p>

<p>They went down the steep pathway, Father Rodwell first, Isola
following, between the crowded graves, the azaleas and camelias,
veronica and guelder rose, lilac and magnolia, and on either hand a
wilderness of roses, red and white.</p>

<p>The shadows of the cypresses closed over them in that deep alley, and
the twilight gloom might seem symbolic of the passage through death to
life; for beyond the gates, and through a gap in the cypress screen,
the level landscape and the city domes and bell-towers were shining in
the yellow light of afternoon.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></p>

<p class="center">"OH, OLD THOUGHTS THEY CLING, THEY CLING!"</p>


<p>Colonel Disney and Allegra were both pleased to welcome Father Rodwell
to their home in the great city; pleased to find that his own rooms
were close by in the Via Babuino, and that he was likely to be their
neighbour for some weeks. His familiarity with all that was worth
seeing in the city and its surroundings made him a valuable companion
for people whose only knowledge had been gathered laboriously from
books. Father Rodwell knew every picture and every statue in the
churches and galleries. There was not a building in Christian or Pagan
Rome which had not its history and its associations for the man who had
chosen the city as the holiday ground of his busy life long before he
left the university, and who had returned again and again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> year after
year, to tread the familiar paths and ponder over the old records. He
had seen many of those monuments of Republic and Empire emerge from
the heaped-up earth of ages; had seen hills cut down, and valleys
laid bare; some picturesque spots made less picturesque; other places
redeemed from ruin. He had seen the squalor and the romance of Mediæval
Rome vanish before the march of improvement; and he had seen the
triumph of the commonplace and the utilitarian in many a scene where
the melancholy beauty of neglect and decay had once been dear to him.</p>

<p>With such a guide it was delightful to loiter amidst the Palace of
the Cæsars, or tread the quiet lanes and by-paths of the Aventine,
that historic hill from whose venerable church the bearers of Christ's
message of peace and love set out for savage Britain. Allegra was
delighted to wander about the city with such a companion, lingering
long before every famous picture, finding out altar-pieces and frescoes
which no guide-book would have helped her to discover; sometimes
disputing Father Rodwell's judgment upon the artistic value of a
picture; sometimes agreeing with him&mdash;always bright, animated, and
intelligent.</p>

<p>Isola joined in these explorations as far as her strength would allow.
She was deeply interested in the churches, and in the stories of priest
and pope, saint and martyr, which Father Rodwell had to tell of every
shrine and tomb, whose splendour might otherwise have seemed colourless
and cold. There was a growing enthusiasm in the attention with which
she listened to every record of that wonder-working Church which
created Christian Rome in all its pomp and dignity of architecture, and
all its glory of art. The splendour of those mighty basilicas filled
her with an awful sense of the majesty of that religion which had
been founded yonder in darkness and in chains, in Paul's subterranean
prison&mdash;yonder in tears where Paul and Peter spoke the solemn words
of parting&mdash;yonder in blood on the dreary road to Ostia, where the
headsman's axe quenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> the greatest light that had shone upon earth
since the sacrifice of Calvary.</p>

<p>Isola went about looking at those things like a creature in a dream.
These stupendous tabernacles impressed her with an almost insupportable
sense of their magnitude. And with that awestricken sense of power in
the Christian Church there was interwoven the humiliating consciousness
of her own unworthiness; a consciousness sharpened and intensified by
every word that Father Rodwell had spoken in that agonizing hour of her
involuntary confession.</p>

<p>He was so kind to her, so gentle, so courteous in every word and act,
that she wondered sometimes whether he had forgotten that miserable
revelation; whether he had forgotten that she was one of the lost ones
of this earth, a woman who had forfeited woman's first claim to man's
esteem. Sometimes she found herself lifting her eyes to his face in an
unpremeditated prayer for pity, as they stood before some exquisite
shrine of the Madonna, and the ineffable purity in the sculptured face
looking down at her struck like a sharp sword into her heart. That mute
appeal of Isola's seemed to ask, "Has the Mother of Christ any pity for
such a sinner as I?"</p>

<p>Colonel Disney was full of thoughtfulness for his wife in all their
going to and fro; and before their day's rambles were half done he
would drive her to any quiet spot where she might choose to spend a
restful hour in the afternoon sunshine&mdash;in this or that convent garden,
in some shaded corner on the Aventine, or among the wild flowers that
flourish and grow rank amidst the ruins of palace and temple on the
Palatine. Her favourite resort was still the English cemetery, and she
always begged to be set down within reach of that familiar gate, where
the custodian knew her as well as if she had been some restless spirit
whose body lay under one of those marble urns, and whose ghost passed
in and out of the gate every day.</p>

<p>It was in vain that her husband or her sister offered to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> her
companion in these restful hours. She always made the same reply.</p>

<p>"I am better alone," she would say. "It does me good to be alone. I
don't like being alone indoors&mdash;I get low-spirited and nervous&mdash;but I
like to sit among the flowers, and to watch the lizards darting in and
out among the graves. I am never dull there. I take a book with me; but
I don't read much. I could sit there for hours in a summer dream."</p>

<p>Martin Disney made a point of giving way to her will in all small
things. She might be capricious, she might have morbid fancies. That
was no business of his. It was his part to indulge her every whim, and
to make her in love with life. All that he asked of Heaven was to spin
out that attenuated thread. All that he desired was to hold her and
keep her for his own against Death himself.</p>

<p>The <i>Vendetta</i> was at Civita Vecchia, from which port her skipper
frequently bore down upon Rome, distracting Allegra from her critical
studies in the picture-galleries, and from her work in her own studio,
a light, airy room on the fourth floor, with a window looking over
the Pincian Gardens. Captain Hulbert was a little inclined to resent
Father Rodwell's frequent presence in the family circle, and his too
accomplished guidance in the galleries. It was provoking to hear a man
talk, with an almost Ruskinesque enthusiasm and critical appreciation,
of pictures which made so faint an appeal to the seaman. Here and
there John Hulbert could see the beauty and merit of a painting, and
was really touched by the influence of supreme art; but of technical
qualities he knew nothing, and could hardly distinguish one master from
another, was as likely as not to take Titian for Veronese, or Tintoret
for Titian.</p>

<p>He looked with a sceptical eye at the Anglican priest's cassock
and girdle. If Father Rodwell had been a Papist it would have been
altogether a more satisfactory state of things; but an Anglican&mdash;a man
who might preach the beauty of holy poverty and a celibate life one
year and marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> a rich widow the year after&mdash;a man bound only by his
own wishes.</p>

<p>Had Allegra been a thought less frank&mdash;had she been a woman whom it
was possible to doubt&mdash;the sailor would have given himself over to the
demon of jealousy; but there are happily some women in whom truth and
purity are so transparently obvious that even an anxious lover cannot
doubt them. Allegra was such an one. No suspicion of coquetry ever
lessened her simple womanliness. She was a woman of whom a man might
make a friend; a woman whose feelings and meanings he could by no
possibility mistake.</p>

<p>He had pleaded his hardest and pleaded in vain for a June wedding.
Isola's state of health was too critical for the contemplation of any
change in the family circle.</p>

<p>"She could not do without me, nor could Martin either," Allegra told
her lover. "It is I who keep house and manage their money, and see
to everything for them. Martin has been utterly helpless since this
saddening anxiety began. He thinks of nothing but Isola, and her
chances of recovery. I cannot leave him while she is so ill."</p>

<p>"Have you any hope of her ever being better, my dear girl?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It has been a long and wearing illness."</p>

<p>"It is not illness, Allegra. It is a gradual decay. My fear is that she
will never revive. There is no marked disease&mdash;nothing for medicine to
fight against. Such cases as hers are the despair of doctors. A spring
has been broken somehow in the human machine. Science cannot mend it."</p>

<p>Allegra was very much of her sweetheart's opinion.</p>

<p>The English doctor in Rome was as kind and attentive as the doctor at
San Remo; but although he had not yet pronounced the case hopeless,
he took a by no means cheerful view of his patient's condition. He
recommended Colonel Disney to leave the city before the third week in
May, and to take his wife to Switzerland, travelling by easy stages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
and doing all he could to amuse and interest her. If on the other hand
it were important for Colonel Disney to be in England, he might take
his wife back to Cornwall in June. But in this case she must return to
the south in October. Lungs and heart were both too weak for the risks
of an English winter.</p>

<p>"We will not go back to England," decided Disney. "My wife is not fond
of Cornwall. Italy has been a delight to her; and Switzerland will be
new ground. God grant the summer may bring about an improvement!"</p>

<p>The doctor said very little, and promised nothing.</p>

<p>Closely as they watched her, with anxious loving looks, it may be that
seeing her every day even their eyes did not mark the gradual decline
of vitality&mdash;the inevitable advance of decay. She never complained; the
cough that marked the disease which had fastened on her lungs since
February was not a loud or seemingly distressing cough. It was only now
and then, when she tried to walk uphill, or over-exerted herself in any
way, that her malady became painfully obvious in the labouring chest,
flushed cheek, and panting breath; but she made light even of these
symptoms, and assured her husband that Rome was curing her.</p>

<p>Her spirits had been less equable since Father Rodwell's appearance.
She had alternated between a feverish intensity and a profound
dejection. Her changes of mood had been sudden and apparently
causeless; and those who watched and cherished her could do nothing to
dispel the gloom that often clouded over her. If she were questioned
she could only say that she was tired. She would never admit any reason
for her melancholy.</p>

<p class="center">"WE'LL BIND YOU FAST IN SILKEN CORDS."</p>


<p>Captain Hulbert was not selfish enough to plead for his personal
happiness in the midst of a household shadowed by the foreboding of a
great sorrow. Martin Disney's face, as he looked at his wife in those
moments which too plainly marked the progress of decay, was in itself
enough to put a check upon a lover's impatience. How could any man
plead for his own pleasure&mdash;for the roses and sunshine of life&mdash;in the
presence of that deep despair?</p>

<p>"He knows that he is doomed to lose her," thought Hulbert; "knows it,
and yet tries to hope. I never saw such intense, unquestioning love.
One asks one's self involuntarily about any woman&mdash;Is she worth it?"</p>

<p>And then he thought of Allegra, truthful and impulsive, strong as
steel, transparent as crystal. Yes, such a woman as that was worth the
whole of a man's heart&mdash;worthy that a man should live or die for her.
But it seemed to him that to compare Isola with Allegra was to liken an
ash sapling to an oak.</p>

<p>He resigned himself to his disappointment, talked no more of Venice
and the starlit lagunes, the summer nights on the Lido, and quoted no
more of Buskin's rhapsodies; but he came meekly day after day to join
in the family excursion, whatever it might be. He had enough and to
spare of ecclesiastical architecture and of the old masters during
those summer-like mornings and afternoons. He heard more than enough of
the mad Cæsars and the bad Cæsars, of wicked Empresses and of low-born
favourites, of despotism throned in the palace and murder waiting at
the gate, of tyranny drunken with power long abused, and treason on the
watch for the golden opportunity to change one profligate master for
another, ready to toss up for the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> Cæsar, and to accept the basest
slave for master, would be but open the Imperial treasury wide enough
to the Prætorian's rapacious hands.</p>

<p>"People gloat over these hoary old walls as if they would like to have
lived under Caligula," said the sailor, with a touch of impatience,
when Father Rodwell had been expatiating upon a little bit of moulding
which decorated an imperial staircase.</p>

<p>"It would have been at least a picturesque time to have lived in," said
Allegra. "Existence must have been a series of pictures by Alma Tadema."</p>

<p>Captain Hulbert was startled out of his state of placid submission by
the intervention of a most unexpected ally.</p>

<p>It was one of the hottest days there had been since they came to Rome.
To cross the Piazza in front of St. Peter's was like plunging into a
bath of molten gold; while to enter the great Basilica itself was like
going into an ice-house. Father Rodwell was not with them upon this
particular morning. They were a party of four, and a roomy landau had
been engaged to take them to the Church of St. Paul beyond the walls,
and thence to the tomb of Cecilia Metella. Isola and Allegra had made
pilgrimages to the spot before to-day. It was a drive they both loved,
a glimpse of the pastoral life outside the gates of the city, and a
place for ever associated with the poet whose verse was written in
their hearts.</p>

<p>They dawdled over a light luncheon of macaroni and Roman wine at a
<i>café</i> near the great cold white church, and then they drove through
the sandy lanes in the heat of the afternoon, languid all of them, and
Isola paler and more weary-looking than she had been for some time. Her
husband watched her anxiously, and wanted to go back to Rome, lest the
drive should be too exhausting for her.</p>

<p>"No, no, I am not tired," she answered impatiently. "I would much
rather go on. I want to see that grim old tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> again," and then she
quoted the familiar lines, dreamily, with a faint pleasure in their
music&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Perchance she died in youth: it may be bowed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That weighed upon her gentle dust."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Besides," she added confusedly, "I want to have a little private
talk with Captain Hulbert, while Allegra is busy with her everlasting
memoranda in that dirty little sketchbook which is stuffed with the
pictures of the future. May I?"</p>

<p>She looked from her husband to Captain Hulbert pleadingly. The latter
was first to answer.</p>

<p>"I am at your service, Mrs. Disney; ready to be interrogated, or
lectured, or advised, whichever you like."</p>

<p>"I am not going to do either of the three. I am going to ask you a
favour."</p>

<p>"Consider that to ask is to be obeyed."</p>

<p>They alighted in the road by the tomb a few minutes afterwards.
Allegra's note-book was out immediately, a true artist's book, crammed
with every conceivable form of artistic reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Go and talk," she said, waving her hand to Isola and Hulbert; and then
she clambered up a bank opposite that tower of other days to get a
vantage ground for her sketch.</p>

<p>She had made a score of sketches on the same spot, but there were
always new details to jot down, new effects and ideas, on that vast
level which frames the grandeur of Rome. Yonder the long line of the
aqueduct; here the living beauty of broad-fronted oxen moving with
stately paces along the dusty way, the incarnation of strength and
majesty, patience and labour.</p>

<p>"Stay here and smoke your cigar, Martin," said Isola, "while Captain
Hulbert and I go for a stroll."</p>

<p>Her husband smiled at her tenderly, cheered by her unwonted
cheerfulness. His days and hours alternated between hope and despair.
This was a moment of hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dearest, you are full of mystery to-day," he said, "and I am as
full of curiosity. But I can wait. Consider me a statue of patience
standing by the way-side, and take your time."</p>

<p>She put her hand through Hulbert's arm, and led him away from the other
two, sauntering slowly along beside the grassy bank.</p>

<p>"I want to talk about your wedding," she said, as soon as they were out
of hearing. "When are you and Allegra going to be married?"</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Disney, you know that I pledged myself to wait a year
from the time of our engagement&mdash;a year from last Christmas&mdash;you must
remember. That was to be my probation."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember; but that is all foolishness&mdash;idle romance. Allegra
knows that you love her. I don't think she could know it any better
after another half-year's devotion on your part."</p>

<p>"I don't think she could know it better after another half century. I
know I could never love her more than I do now. I know I shall never
love her less."</p>

<p>"I believe that you are good and true," said Isola. "As true
and&mdash;almost&mdash;as good as he is"&mdash;with a backward glance at her husband.
"If I did not believe that I should not have thought of saying what I
am going to say."</p>

<p>"I am honoured by your confidence in me."</p>

<p>"I love Allegra too well to hazard her happiness. I know she loves
you&mdash;has never cared for any one else. She was heart-whole till she
saw you. She had no more thought of love, or lovers, than a child. I
want you to marry her soon, Captain Hulbert&mdash;very soon, before we leave
Rome. Would you not like to be married in Rome?"</p>

<p>"I would like to be married in Kamtchatka, or Nova Zembla&mdash;or the worst
of those places whose very names suggest uncomfortableness. There is no
dismallest corner of the earth which Allegra could not glorify and make
dear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> But, as you suggest, Rome is classic&mdash;Rome is mediæval&mdash;Rome is
Roman Catholic. It would be a new sensation for a plain man like me to
be married in Rome. I suppose it could not be managed in St. Peter's?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Hulbert, I want you to be serious."</p>

<p>"I am serious. Why, this is a matter of life or death to me. But I
pleaded so hard for a June wedding&mdash;and to no purpose. I talked with
the artfulness of the first Tempter&mdash;I tried to play upon her vanities
as an artist. All in vain!"</p>

<p>"Tell her that I have set my heart upon seeing her married," said
Isola, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, you will see her married, whether she be married in
Rome or at Trelasco. That is no argument."</p>

<p>"But it is; indeed it is. Tell her that, if I am to be at her wedding,
it must be soon, very soon. Life is so uncertain at best&mdash;and, although
I feel well and strong, sometimes&mdash;to-day, for instance&mdash;there are
other times when I think the end is nearer than even my doctor
suspects. And I know by his face that he does not give me a long lease
of life."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Disney, this is morbid. I am grieved to hear you talk in
such a strain."</p>

<p>"Don't notice that. Don't say anything depressing to Allegra. I want
her to go off to her Venetian honeymoon very happily&mdash;with not one
cloud in her sky. She has been so good and dear to me. It would be
hard if I could not rejoice in her happiness. I have rejoiced in it
always; I shall take pleasure in it to the end of my life. It is the
one unclouded spot&mdash;&mdash;." She stopped with a troubled air. "Yes, it is a
happy fate&mdash;to have cared for one, and one only, and to be loved again.
Will you do what I ask you, Captain Hulbert? will you hurry on the
wedding&mdash;for my sake?"</p>

<p>"I would do anything difficult and unwelcome for your sake&mdash;how much
more will I hasten my own happiness&mdash;if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> can. But Allegra is a
difficult personage&mdash;as firm as rock when she has once made up her
mind. And she has made up her mind to stay with you till you are quite
well and strong again."</p>

<p>"She need not leave me for ever, because she marries. She can come
back to me after a long honeymoon. We can all meet in Switzerland in
August&mdash;if&mdash;if I go there with Martin, as he proposes."</p>

<p>"Well, I will try to bend that stubborn will."</p>

<p>"And you don't mind having a quiet wedding, if she consents to a much
earlier date?"</p>

<p>"Mind? The quieter the better for me! I think a smart wedding is a
preventive of matrimony. That sounds like a bull. I will say I think
there are many wretched bachelors living in dismal chambers, and preyed
upon by landladies, who might have been happily married, but for the
fear of a smart wedding. We will have as quiet a wedding as you and
Disney can desire; but I should like Lostwithiel to be present. He is
my only near relation, and I don't want to cut him on the happiest day
of my life. Why, Mrs. Disney, you are trembling! You have agitated
yourself about this business; you have talked too much for your
strength. Let me take you back to the carriage."</p>

<p>"Presently&mdash;yes, yes. The heat overcame me for a moment, that's all.
Would you mind not waiting for Lord Lostwithiel? I want the marriage to
be at once&mdash;directly&mdash;as soon as Father Rodwell can get it arranged.
And you don't know where a telegram would reach your brother?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do not; but by speculating a few messages of inquiry I could
soon find out the whereabouts of the <i>Eurydice</i>."</p>

<p>"Don't wait for that. There would be delay. There must be delay if you
have to consult any distant person's convenience. We are all here&mdash;you
and Allegra, and Martin and I&mdash;and Father Rodwell would like to marry
you. What do you want with anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I think you are right! Allegra is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> creature of
impulse&mdash;where principle is not at stake. If I asked her to marry me
six weeks hence she would parley and make terms. If I ask her to marry
me in a few days&mdash;before we leave Rome&mdash;she may consent. Have you
talked to your husband? Is he of your opinion?"</p>

<p>"I have said nothing to him; but I know he would be pleased to see you
and Allegra bound together for life."</p>

<p>"I will talk to him this afternoon. One can get everything one wants
in Rome, I believe, from a papal dispensation down to an English
solicitor. If we can but rattle through some kind of marriage
settlement to your husband's satisfaction we can be married on the
earliest day to which my darling will consent. God bless you, Mrs.
Disney, for your unselfish thought of other people's happiness! You are
not like most invalids, who would let a sister languish in lifelong
spinsterhood rather than lose her as a nurse. God grant that your
unselfishness may be recompensed by speedy recovery!"</p>

<p>"There will be a weight off my mind when you and Allegra are married,"
said Isola, gravely.</p>

<p>They walked slowly back to the spot where they had left their
companions. A pair of oxen, with an empty cart, were standing in
the road below the tomb, their driver lounging across the rough
vehicle&mdash;man and beasts motionless as marble. Allegra sat on a hillock
opposite, sketching the group. She had bribed the man to draw up for a
brief halt while she made her sketch. The massive heads were drooping
under the afternoon sun; the tawny and cream-hued coats were stained
with dust and purpled with the sweat of patient labour. The creatures
looked as gracious and as wise as if they had been gods in disguise.</p>

<p>"Now, Allegra," said her brother, emptying the ashes out of his pipe,
"are you ready to go home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have just jotted down what will serve to remind me of those
splendid beasts; but I should like to have them standing there all
day, so that I could paint them seriously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> They are the finest models
I have seen in Rome. Have you two quite finished your secrets and
mysteries?" she asked, smiling at Isola, who was looking brighter than
usual.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have said all I had to say, and have been answered as I wished
to be answered. I shall go home very happy."</p>

<p>"That's a good hearing," said Disney, as he helped her into the landau.</p>

<p>Allegra had talked of wanting to revisit Caracalla's Baths, a wish
of which Isola reminded her as they drove back to the city, along
the Appian Way: whereupon Captain Hulbert suggested that he and his
sweetheart should stop to explore the ruins, while Disney and Isola
went home.</p>

<p>Allegra blushed and consented, always a little shy at being alone with
her lover, especially since he had pleaded go earnestly for a summer
honeymoon.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Disney, your right place in Rome would be the Embassy," murmured
Hulbert as he shut the carriage door; "you are a born diplomatist."</p>

<p>"What makes my dearest look so pleased and happy this afternoon?" asked
Disney, as he changed to the seat beside his wife.</p>

<p>"I am glad because I think Captain Hulbert will persuade Allegra to
marry him before we leave Rome. I begged him to hasten their marriage.
That was my mystery, Martin. That was what he and I were talking about."</p>

<p>"But why wish to hasten matters, dear? They are very happy as it
is&mdash;and a year is not a long engagement."</p>

<p>"Too long for me, Martin. I want to see her happy&mdash;I want to see them
married before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before what, dear love?" he asked tenderly.</p>

<p>"Before we leave Rome."</p>

<p>"That would be very short work. We leave in a fortnight. The weather
will be growing too hot for you if we linger later."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but everything can be settled in less time than that. Ask Father
Rodwell. He knows Rome so well that he can help you to arrange all
details."</p>

<p>"I thought that every young woman required at least six months for the
preparation of her trousseau?"</p>

<p>"Not such a girl as Allegra. She is always well dressed, and her
wardrobe is the perfection of neatness&mdash;but she is not the kind of girl
to make a fuss about her clothes. I don't think the trousseau will
create any difficulty."</p>

<p>"And when she is gone, what will you do without your devoted companion?
Who will nurse you and take care of you?"</p>

<p>"Löttchen, or any other servant," she answered, with a kind of weary
indifference. "It would be very hard if my bad health should stand in
the way of Allegra's happiness. So long as you will stay with me and be
kind to me, Martin, I need no one else."</p>

<p>Tears were streaming down her cheeks as she turned from him, pretending
to be interested in the convent walls on the edge of the hill below
which they were driving.</p>

<p>"So long as I stay with you! My darling, do you think business or
pleasure, or any claim in this world, will ever take me from you any
more? All your hours are precious to me, Isola. I hardly live when I am
away from you. Wherever your doctor may send you, or your own fancy may
lead you, I shall go with you, unhesitatingly&mdash;without one regret for
anything I leave behind."</p>

<p>"Don't say these things," she cried suddenly, with a choking sob; "you
are too good to me. There are times when I can't bear it."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></p>

<p class="center">"SO, FULL CONTENT SHALL HENCEFORTH BE MY LOT."</p>


<p>Allegra was not inexorable. There, in the ruins of the Imperial baths,
where Shelley dreamed the wonder-dream of his Prometheus, Captain
Hulbert pleaded his cause. Could love resist the pleading of so fond
a lover? Could art withstand the allurements of Venice&mdash;Titian and
Tintoret, the cathedral of St. Mark and the Palace of the Doges, the
birthplace of Desdemona and of Shylock, the home of Byron and of
Browning?</p>

<p>She consented to a Roman marriage.</p>

<p>"I can't help wishing I could be a Papist just for that one day," she
said lightly. "An Anglican marriage seems so dry and cold compared with
the pomps and splendours of Rome."</p>

<p>"Dearest, the plainest Christian rites are enough, if they but make us
one."</p>

<p>"I think we are that already, John," she answered shyly; and then,
nestling by his side as they sat in the wide solitude of that
stupendous pile, she took his hand and held it in both her own, looking
down at it wonderingly&mdash;a well-formed hand, strong and muscular,
broadened a little by seafaring.</p>

<p>"And you are to be my husband," she said. "Mine! I shall speak of
you to people as my own peculiar property. 'My husband will do this
or that.' 'My husband has gone out, but he will be home soon.' Home.
Husband. How strange it sounds!"</p>

<p>"Strange and wonderful now, love. Sweet and familiar before our
honeymoon is ended."</p>

<p>They went out of the broad spaces that were once populous with the
teeming life of Imperial Rome, splendid with all that art could create
of beauty and of grandeur&mdash;wrapt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> in the glamour of their dream. They
walked all the way to the Piazza di Spagna in the same happy dream, as
unconscious of the ground they trod on as if they had been floating in
the air.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were a very cheerful party at dinner that evening. Father Rodwell
dined with them, and was delighted at the idea of having to marry these
happy lovers. He took the arrangement of the ceremony into his own
hands. The English chaplain was his old friend, and would let him do
what he liked in his church.</p>

<p>"It is to be a very quiet wedding," said the colonel, when the three
men were smoking together in a loggia, looking on the little garden
of orange trees and oleanders, in the grey dim beginning of night,
when the thin crescent moon was shining in a sky still faintly flushed
with sunset. "Isa could not stand anything like bustle or excitement.
Luckily we have no friends in Rome. There is no one belonging to us who
could be aggrieved at not being invited."</p>

<p>"And there is no one except Lostwithiel on my side who has the
slightest claim to be present," said Hulbert. "I am almost as well
off as the Flying Dutchman in that respect. I am not troubled with
relations. All the kinsfolk I have are distant, and I allow them to
remain so. My dear Disney, so far as I am concerned, our wedding cannot
be too quiet a business. It is the bride I want, mark you, not the fuss
and flowers, wedding-breakfast, and bridesmaids. Let us be married at
half-past ten, and drive from the church to the railway station in time
for the noonday train. I have given up my dream of taking Allegra round
Southern Italy to the Adriatic. We shall go to Florence first, and
spend a few days in the galleries, and thence to Venice, where we will
have the <i>Vendetta</i> brought to us, and anchored near the arsenal, ready
to carry us away directly we are tired of the city of old memories."</p>

<p>Father Rodwell left them and went into the drawing-room, where Isola
and her sister-in-law were sitting in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> lamplight&mdash;Isola's hands
occupied with that soft, fluffy knitting which seemed to exercise a
soothing influence upon her nerves; Allegra leaning over the table,
idly sketching random reminiscences of the Baths, the Tomb, the
grave-eyed oxen, with their great curving horns and ponderous foreheads.</p>

<p>The priest was interested in watching Isola this evening. He saw a
marked change in the expression of her countenance, a change which was
perceptible to him even in her voice and manner&mdash;a brightness which
might mean a lightened heart, or which might mean religious exaltation.</p>

<p>"Has she told him?" he wondered, studying her from his place in the
shadow as the lamplight shone full upon her wasted features and hectic
colouring. "Has she taken courage and confessed her sin to that loyal,
loving husband, and is the burden lifted from her heart?"</p>

<p>No; he could not believe that she had lifted the veil from the sad
secret of her past. Martin Disney's unclouded brow to-night was not
that of a man who had lately discovered that the wife he loved had
betrayed him. There might be pardon&mdash;there might be peace between
husband and wife after such a revelation; but there could not be the
serenity which marked Martin Disney's manner to his wife to-night. Such
a thunder-clap must leave its brand upon the man who suffered it. No;
her secret was still locked in her impenitent heart. Sorry&mdash;yes. She
had drunk the cup of remorse in all its bitterness; but she knew not
true penitence, the Christian's penitence, which means self-abasement
and confession. And yet she seemed happier. There was a look of almost
holy resignation upon the pale and placid brow, and in the too-lustrous
eyes. Something had happened&mdash;some moral transformation which made her
a new being.</p>

<p>Father Rodwell drew his chair nearer to her, and looked at her
earnestly with his cordial, almost boyish smile. He was a remarkably
young-looking man, a man upon whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> long years of toil in the dark
places of the earth had exercised no wasting or withering influence. He
had loved his work too well ever to feel the pressure of the burdens
he carried. His gospel had been always a cheerful gospel, and he had
helped to lighten sorrows, never to make them heavier. He was deeply
interested in Isola, and had been watchful of all her changes of mood
since their conversation in the shadow of the old Roman wall. He
had seen her impressed by the history and traditions of the church,
moved by the pathos of holy lives, touched almost to tears by sacred
pictures, and he saw in her character and disposition a natural bent
towards piety, exactly that receptive temperament which moves holy
women to lives of self-abnegation and heroic endeavour. He had lent
her some of those books which he loved best and read most himself,
and he had talked with her of religion, careful not to say too much
or with too strong an emphasis, and never by any word alluding to her
revelation of past guilt. He wanted to win her to perfect trustfulness
in him, to teach her to lean upon him in her helplessness; until the
hour should come when she would let him lead her to her husband, in the
self-abasement of the penitent sinner.</p>

<p>He knew that in this desire he exceeded the teaching of churchmen; that
another priest in his place might have bade her keep her sad secret to
the end, he down with it in her early grave, be remembered as a saint,
yet die knowing herself a sinner. If he had thought of the husband's
peace first, he would have counselled silence. But he thought most of
this stricken soul, with wings that spread themselves towards heaven,
held down to earth by the burden of an unpardoned sin.</p>

<p>He looked at her in the lamplight, and her eyes met his with a
straighter outlook than he had seen in them for a long time. She looked
actually happy, and that look of happiness in a face on which death
has set its seal has always something which suggests a life beyond the
grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"The excitement of this marriage question has brightened you
wonderfully, Mrs. Disney," he said. "We shall have you in high health
by the wedding-day."</p>

<p>"I am feeling better because I am so glad," Isola answered naively,
putting her hand into Allegra's.</p>

<p>"I consider it positively insulting to me as a sister," exclaimed
Allegra, bending down to kiss the too-transparent hand&mdash;such a hand as
she had seen in many a picture of dying saint in the Roman galleries.
"You are most unaffectionately rejoiced to get rid of me. I have
evidently been a tyrannical nurse, and a dull companion, and you
breathe more freely at the prospect of release."</p>

<p>"You have been all that is dear and good," Isola answered softly, "and
I shall feel dreadfully lonely without you; but it won't be for long.
And I shall be so comforted by the knowledge that nothing can come
between you and your life's happiness."</p>

<p>The two men came in from the loggia, bringing with them the cool breath
of night. Isola went to the piano and played one of those Adagios of
Mozart's which came just within the limit of her modest powers, and
which she played to perfection, all her soul in the long lingering
phrases, the tender modulations, with their suggestions of shadowy
cathedral aisles, and the smoke of incense in the deepening dusk
of a vesper service. Those bits of Mozart, the slow movements from
the Sonatas, an Agnus Dei, or an Ave Maria from one of the Masses,
satisfied Captain Hulbert's highest ideas of music. He desired nothing
grander or more scientific. The new learning of the Wagnerian school
had no charm for him.</p>

<p>"If you ask me about modern composers, I am for Verdi and Gounod," he
said. "For gaiety and charm, give me Auber, Rossini, and Boieldieu&mdash;for
pathos, Weber&mdash;for everything, Mozart. There you have the whole of my
musical education."</p>

<p>The question of settlements was opened seriously between Martin Disney
and his future brother-in-law, early on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> following morning. Hulbert
wanted to settle all the money he had in the world upon Allegra.</p>

<p>"She is ever so much wiser than I am," he said. "So she had better be
my treasurer. My property is all in stocks and shares. My grandfather
was fond of stock-jobbing, and made some very lucky investments which
he settled upon my mother, with strict injunctions that they should
not be meddled with by her trustees. My share of her fortune comes to
a little over nine hundred a year. I came into possession of it when I
came of age, and it is mine to dispose of as I like, trusts expired,
trustees cleared off&mdash;in point of fact, both gone over to the majority,
poor old souls, after having had many an anxious hour about those South
American railway bonds, and Suez Canal shares, which turned up trumps
after all. I've telegraphed to the family lawyer for a schedule of the
property, and when that comes, just tie it all up in as tight a knot as
the law can tie, and let it belong to Allegra and her children after
her. Consider me paid off."</p>

<p>Martin Disney laughed at the lover's impetuosity&mdash;and told him that
he should be allowed to bring so much and no more into settlement.
Allegra's income was less than two hundred a year, a poor little income
upon which she had fancied herself rich, so modest is woman's measure
of independence as compared with man's. It would be for the lawyer to
decide what proportion the husband's settlements should bear to the
wife's income. Father Rodwell had given Colonel Disney an introduction
to a solicitor of high character, a man who had occupied an excellent
position in London until damaged lungs obliged him to seek a home in
the south.</p>

<p>With this gentleman's aid, matters were soon put in train, and while
the men were in the lawyer's office, the two women were choosing
Allegra's wedding-gown.</p>

<p>The young lady had exhibited a rare indifference upon the great
trousseau question. She was not one of those girls whose finery is all
external, and who hide rags and tatters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> under æsthetic colouring and
Raffaelle draperies. She was too much of an artist to endure anything
unseemly in her belongings, and her everyday clothes, just as they
were, might have been exhibited, like a Royal trousseau, without
causing any other comment than, "How nice!" "What good taste!" "What
exquisite needlework!"</p>

<p>The hands which painted such clever pictures were as skilful with
the needle as with the brush, and Allegra had never considered that
a vocation for art meant uselessness in every feminine industry. She
had attended to her own wardrobe from the time she learnt plain sewing
at her first school; and now, as she and Isola looked over the ample
array of under-linen, the pretty cambric peignoirs, and neatly trimmed
petticoats, they were both of one mind, that there was very little need
of fuss or expenditure.</p>

<p>"I have plenty of summer frocks," said Allegra. "So really there is
only my travelling gown to see about, that is to say, the gown I am to
be married in."</p>

<p>"But you must have a real wedding-gown, all the same, a white
satin gown, with lace and pearls," pleaded Isola. "When you go to
dinner-parties, by-and-by, you will be expected to look like a bride."</p>

<p>"Dinner-parties! Oh, those are a long way off. We are not likely to be
asked to any parties while we are wandering about Italy. I can get a
gown when I go home."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Allegra's wedding-day had dawned&mdash;a glorious day&mdash;a day to make one
drunken with the beauty of sky and earth; a day when the vetturini in
the Piazza di Spagna sat and dreamt on their coach-boxes&mdash;narcotized by
the sun&mdash;when the reds and blues in the garments of the flower-women
were almost too dazzling for the eye to look upon, and when every
garden in the city sent forth tropical odours of roses steeped in
sunlight.</p>

<p>The church in which the lovers were to be made one was a very homely
temple as compared with the basilicas yonder on the hills of Rome. But
what did that matter to Allegra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> this morning as she stood before the
altar and spoke the words which gave her to the man she loved? A flood
of sunshine streamed upon the two figures of bride and bridegroom, and
touched the almost spectral face of the bride's sister-in-law, a face
which attracted as much attention as the bride's fresh bloom and happy
smile. It was a face marked for death, yet beautiful in decay. The
large violet eyes were luminous with the light of worlds beyond the
world we know. There was something loftier than happiness in that vivid
look, something akin to exaltation&mdash;the smile of the martyr at the
stake&mdash;the martyr for whom Heaven's miraculous intervention changes the
flames of the death-pile into the soft fanning of seraphic wings; the
martyr unconscious of earthly pains and earthly cruelties; who sees the
skies opening and the glorious company of saints and angels gathered
about the great white throne.</p>

<p>Father Rodwell saw that spiritual expression in the pale, wasted face,
and he told himself that a lost soul could not look out of eyes like
those. If death were near, as he feared, the true repentance for which
he had prayed many an earnest prayer was not far off.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bride and bridegroom were to leave Rome by the mid-day train. Colonel
Disney was going to see the last of them at the station, but Isola and
her sister-in-law were to say good-bye in the vestry, and to part at
the church door. And now Father Rodwell's brief, but fervent, address
had been spoken, the Wedding March pealed from the organ, and the small
wedding-party went into the vestry to sign the registers.</p>

<p>Isola was called upon for her signature as one of the witnesses. She
signed in a bold, clear hand, without one tremulous line, her husband
looking over her shoulder as she wrote.</p>

<p>"That doesn't look like an invalid's autograph, does it, Hulbert?" he
asked, snatching at every token of hope, unwilling to believe what his
doctors and his own convictions told him&mdash;expecting a miracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>They had warned him that he could not keep her long. They had advised
him to humour her fancies, to let her be present at the wedding,
even at the hazard of her suffering afterwards for that exertion and
excitement. She would suffer more perhaps&mdash;physically as well as
mentally&mdash;if she were thwarted in her natural wish to be by Allegra's
side on that day.</p>

<p>All was finished. Neither Church nor law could do anything more towards
making the lovers man and wife. The law might undo the bond for them in
the time to come, but the part of the Church was done for ever. In the
eye of the Church their union was indissoluble.</p>

<p>Isola clung with her arms round the bride's neck.</p>

<p>"Think of me sometimes, dearest, in the years to come. Think that I
loved you fondly. Be sure that I was grateful for all your goodness to
me," she said tearfully.</p>

<p>"My own love, I shall think of you every day till we meet again."</p>

<p>"And if we never meet again on earth&mdash;will you remember me kindly?"</p>

<p>"Isa, how can you?" cried Allegra, silencing the pale lips with kisses.</p>

<p>"You may be glad to think how much you did towards making my life
happy&mdash;happier than it ought to have been." Isola went on in a low
voice. "Dearest, I am more glad of your marriage than words can say;
and, Allegra, love him with all your heart, and never let your lives be
parted&mdash;remember, dearest, never, never let anything upon this earth
part you from him."</p>

<p>Her voice was choked with sobs, and then came a worse fit of coughing
than she had suffered for some time; a fit which left her exhausted and
speechless. Her husband looked at her in an agony of apprehension.</p>

<p>"Let me take you home, Isa," he said. "You'll be better at home, lying
down by your sunny window. This vestry is horribly cold. Hulbert, if
you and Allegra will excuse me, I won't see you off at the station.
Father Rodwell will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> go with you, perhaps. He'll be of more use than I
could be; and we shall see each other very soon again in Switzerland,
please God."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, There is no need for you to go," Hulbert answered, grasping
his hand, distressed for another man's pain in the midst of his own
happiness. There death, and the end of all joy&mdash;here the new life with
its promises of gladness just opening before him. Such contrasts must
needs seem hard.</p>

<p>They all went to the church door, where the carriages were waiting.
Only a few idlers loitered about the pavement, faintly interested in
so shabby a wedding&mdash;a poor array of one landau and one brougham, the
brougham to take the travellers to the station, where their luggage had
been sent by another conveyance.</p>

<p>The two women kissed each other once more before Allegra stepped into
the carriage, Isola too weak for speech, and able only to clasp the
hands that had waited on her in so many a weary hour; the clever hands,
the gentle hands, to which womanly instinct and womanly love had given
all the skilfulness of a trained nurse.</p>

<p>Disney lifted his wife into the landau, Father Rodwell helping him,
full of sympathy.</p>

<p>"You'll dine with us to-night, I hope," said the colonel. "We shall be
very low if we are left to ourselves."</p>

<p>"I've an engagement for this evening&mdash;but&mdash;yes, I'll get myself
excused, and spend the evening with you, if you really want me."</p>

<p>"Indeed we do," answered Disney, heartily; but Isola was dumb. Her eyes
were fixed upon the distant point at which the brougham had disappeared
round a corner, on its way to the station.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></p>

<p class="center">"GONE DEEPER THAN ALL PLUMMETS SOUND."</p>


<p>Church bells are always ringing in that city of many churches, and
there were bells ringing solemnly and slowly as Isola walked feebly up
the two flights of stairs that led to Colonel Disney's lodging. She
walked even more slowly than usual, and her husband could hear her
labouring breath as she went up, step by step, leaning on the banister
rail. He had offered her his arm, but she had repulsed him, almost
rudely, at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>They went into the drawing-room, which was bright with flowers in a
sunlit dusk, the sun streaming in through the narrow opening between
the Venetian shutters, which had been drawn together, but not fastened.
All was very still in the quiet house; so still that they could hear
the splash of the fountain in the Piazza, and the faint rustling of the
limes in the garden.</p>

<p>Husband and wife stood facing each other, he anxious and alarmed, she
deadly pale, and with gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, she is gone&mdash;she is Mrs. Hulbert now, and she belongs to him
and not to us any more," said Disney, talking at random, watching his
wife's face in nervous apprehension of&mdash;he knew not what. "We shall
miss her sadly. Aren't you sorry she is married, Isola, after all?"</p>

<p>"Sorry! No! I am glad&mdash;glad with all my heart. I have waited for that."</p>

<p>And then, before he was aware, she had flung herself at his feet, and
was kneeling there, with her head hanging down, her hands clasped&mdash;a
very Magdalen.</p>

<p>"I waited&mdash;till they were married&mdash;so that you should not refuse to
let her marry&mdash;his brother&mdash;waited to tell you what I ought to have
told you at once, when you came home from India. My only hope of pardon
or of peace was to have told you then&mdash;to have left you for ever
then&mdash;never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> to have dared to clasp your hand&mdash;never to have dared to
call myself your wife&mdash;never to have become the mother of your child.
All my life since that day has been one long lie; and nothing that I
have suffered&mdash;not all my agonies of remorse&mdash;can atone for that lie,
unless God and you will accept my confession and my atonement to-day."</p>

<p>"Isola, for God's sake, stop!"</p>

<p>Again the racking cough seized her, and she sank speechless at his feet.</p>

<p>He lifted her in his arms and carried her to the sofa, and flung open
the shutters and let the light and air stream in upon her, as she lay
prostrate and exhausted, wiping her white lips with a blood-stained
handkerchief. He looked at her in a kind of horrified compassion.
He thought that she was raving, that the excitement of the morning
had culminated in fever and delirium. He was going to ring for help,
meaning to send instantly for her doctor, when she stopped him, laying
her thin cold hand upon his arm, and holding him by her side.</p>

<p>"Sit down by me, Martin&mdash;don't stop me&mdash;I must tell you&mdash;all&mdash;the
truth."</p>

<p>Her words came slowly, in gasps; then with a great effort she gathered
up the poor remnant of her strength, and went on in a low, tremulous
voice, yet with the tone of one whose resolve was strong as death
itself.</p>

<p>"There was a time when I thought I could never tell you&mdash;that I must go
down to my grave with my sin unrevealed, and that you would never know
how worthless a woman you had loved and cherished. Then, on my knees
before my God, I vowed that I would tell you all, at the last, when I
was dying&mdash;and death is not far off now, Martin. I have delayed too
long&mdash;too long! There is scarcely any atonement in my confession now. I
have cheated you out of your love."</p>

<p>He looked at her horror-stricken, their two faces close to each other
as he bent over her pillow.</p>

<p>No; this was no delirium&mdash;there was a terrible reality in her words.
The eyes looking up at him were not bright with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> fever, but with the
steady resolute soul within&mdash;the soul panting for freedom from sin.</p>

<p>"You have cheated me out of my love," he repeated slowly. "Does that
mean that you lied to me that night in London&mdash;that you perjured
yourself, calling God to witness that you were pure and true?"</p>

<p>"I was true to you then, Martin. My sin had been repented of. I was
your loving, loyal wife, without one thought but of you."</p>

<p>"Loving, loyal!" he cried, with passionate scorn. "You had deceived
and dishonoured me&mdash;you had made your name a by-word&mdash;a jest for such
a man as Vansittart Crowther&mdash;and for how many more? You had lied, and
lied, and lied to me&mdash;by every look, by every word that made you seem a
virtuous woman and a faithful wife. My God, what misery!"</p>

<p>"Martin, have pity!"</p>

<p>"Pity! Yes, I pity the women in the streets! Am I to pity you, as
I pity them? You, whom I worshipped&mdash;whom I thought as pure as the
angels&mdash;wearing nothing of earth but your frail loveliness, which to me
always seemed more of spirit than of clay. And you were false all the
time&mdash;false as hell&mdash;the toy of the first idle profligate whom chance
flung into your path? It was Lostwithiel! That man was right. He would
hardly have dared to talk to you as he did if he had not been certain
of his facts. Lostwithiel was your lover."</p>

<p>"Martin, have pity!" she repeated, with her hands clasped before her
face.</p>

<p>"Pity! Don't I tell you that I pity you&mdash;pity you whom I used to
revere! Great God! can you guess what pain it is to change respect
for the creature one loves into pity? I told you that I would never
hurt you&mdash;that I would never bring shame upon you, Isola. You have no
unkindness to fear from me. But you have broken my heart, you have
slain my faith in man and woman. I could have staked my life on your
purity&mdash;I could have killed the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> slandered you&mdash;and you swore a
false oath&mdash;you called upon Heaven to witness a lie!"</p>

<p>"I was a miserable creature, Martin. I could not bear to lose your
love. If death had been my only penalty I could have borne it, but not
the loss of your love."</p>

<p>"And your sister and her husband? They were as ready with their lies as
you were," he exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Don't blame Gwendolen. I telegraphed to her, imploring her to stand by
me&mdash;to say that I was in London with her."</p>

<p>"And you were not in London?"</p>

<p>"No, except to pass through, when&mdash;when I had escaped from him, and was
on my way home."</p>

<p>"Escaped! My God! What villainy must have been used against you&mdash;so
young, so helpless! Tell me all&mdash;without reserve&mdash;as freely as you want
to be forgiven."</p>

<p>"I was not utterly wicked, Martin. I did not sin deliberately&mdash;I did
not know what I was doing when I wrecked my life and destroyed my
peace of mind for ever. I never meant to forget you&mdash;or to be false to
you&mdash;but I was so lonely&mdash;so lonely. The days were so dreary and so
long&mdash;even the short autumn days seemed long&mdash;and the evenings were
so melancholy without you. And he came into my life suddenly&mdash;like a
prince in a fairy tale&mdash;and at first I thought very little about him.
He was nothing more to me than any one else in Trelasco&mdash;and then
somehow we were always meeting by accident&mdash;in the lanes&mdash;or by the
sea&mdash;and he seemed to care for all the things I cared for. The books I
loved were his favourites. For a long time we talked of nothing but his
travels, and of my favourite books. There was not a word spoken between
us that you or any one else could blame."</p>

<p>"A common opening," said Martin Disney, with scathing contempt. "One of
the seducer's favourite leads."</p>

<p>"And then, one evening in the twilight, he told me that he loved me.
I was very angry&mdash;and I let him see that I was angry, and I did all I
could to avoid him after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> that evening. I refused to go to the ball at
Lostwithiel, knowing that I must meet him there. But they all persuaded
me&mdash;Mrs. Crowther, Mrs. Baynham, Tabitha&mdash;they were all bent upon
making me go&mdash;and I went. Oh, God, if I had but stood firm against
their foolish persuasion, if I had but been true to myself! But my
own heart fought against me. I wanted to see him again&mdash;if only for
the last time. He had talked about starting for a long cruise to the
Mediterranean. His yacht was ready to sail at an hours notice."</p>

<p>"You went, and you were lost."</p>

<p>"Yes, lost, irretrievably lost! It is all one long, wild dream when
I look back upon it. He implored me to go away with him&mdash;but I told
him no, no, no, not for worlds, nothing should ever make me false
to my husband&mdash;nothing. I swore it&mdash;swore an oath which I had not
the strength to keep. Oh, it was cruel, heartless, treacherous&mdash;the
thing he did after that. When I was going away from the dance, he
was there at my side&mdash;and he put me into the wrong carriage&mdash;his own
carriage&mdash;and when I had been driven a little way from the hotel,
the carriage stopped and he got in. I thought that he was driving me
home. I asked him how he could be cruel as to be with me, in his own
carriage, at the risk of my reputation&mdash;but he stopped me&mdash;shut my lips
with his fatal kiss. Oh, Martin, how can I tell these things? The horse
went almost at a gallop. I thought we should be killed. I was half
fainting when the carriage stopped at last, after rattling up and down
hill&mdash;and he lifted me out, and I felt the cold night-air on my face,
the salt spray from the sea. I tried to ask him where I was,&mdash;whether
this was home&mdash;but the words died on my lips&mdash;and I knew no more&mdash;knew
no more till I woke from that dead, dull swoon in the cabin of the
<i>Vendetta</i>, and heard the sailors calling out to each other, and saw
Lostwithiel sitting by my side&mdash;and then&mdash;and then&mdash;it was all one long
dream&mdash;a dream of days and nights, and rain, and tempest. I thought the
boat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> going down in that dreadful night in the Bay of Biscay. Would
to God that she had gone down, and hidden me and my sin for ever! But
she lived through the storm, and in the morning she was anchored near
Arcachon, and Lostwithiel went on shore, and sent a woman in a boat, to
bring me clothes, and to attend upon me; and I contrived to go on shore
with the woman when she went back in the boat that had brought her,
and I borrowed some money on my ring at a jeweller's in Arcachon, and
I left by the first train for Paris, and went on from Paris to London,
and never stopped to rest anywhere till I got home."</p>

<p>"May God bring me face to face with that ruffian who imposed upon your
helplessness!" cried Martin Disney.</p>

<p>"No, no, Martin; he was not a ruffian. He betrayed me&mdash;but I loved
him. He knew that I loved him. I was a great a sinner as be. I was his
before he stole me from my home&mdash;his in mind and in spirit. It was our
unhappy fate to love each other. And I forgave him, Martin. I forgave
him on that night of tempest, when I thought we were going to die
together."</p>

<p>"You don't expect me to forgive him, do you? You don't expect me to
forgive the seducer who has ruined your life and mine?"</p>

<p>"His brother is your sister's husband, Martin?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, John Hulbert is good; he is frank and true. He is not like the
other. But oh, Martin, pity Lostwithiel and his sin, as you pity me and
my sin! It is past and done. I was mad when I cared for him&mdash;a creature
under a spell. You won my heart back to you by your goodness&mdash;you made
me more than ever your own. All that he had ever been to me&mdash;all that I
had ever thought or felt about him&mdash;was blotted out as if I had never
seen his face. Nothing remained but my love for you&mdash;and my guilty
conscience, the aching misery of knowing that I was unworthy of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>He took her hand and pressed it gently in silence. Then, after a long
pause, when she had dried the tears from her streaming eyes, and was
lying faint, and white, and still, caring very little what became of
her poor remnant of life, he said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I forgive you, Isola, as I pray God to forgive you. I have spent some
happy years with you&mdash;not knowing. If it was a delusion, it was very
sweet&mdash;while it lasted."</p>

<p>"It was not a delusion," she cried, putting her arms round his neck, in
a sudden rapture at being pardoned. "My love was real."</p>

<p>The door opened softly, and the kindly face of the Anglican priest
looked in.</p>

<p>"I have seen the lovers on their way to Florence," he said, "and have
come to ask how Mrs. Disney is after her fatiguing morning."</p>

<p>"I am happier than I have been for a long time," answered Isola,
holding out her hand to him. "I am prepared for the end, let it come
when it may."</p>

<p>He knew what she meant, and that the sinner had confessed her sin.</p>

<p>"Come out for a stroll with me, Disney," he said, "and leave your wife
to rest for a little while. I'm afraid she'll miss her kind nurse."</p>

<p>Disney started up confusedly, like a sleeper awakened, and looked at
his watch.</p>

<p>"I believe I have a substitute ready to replace Allegra by this time,"
he said, ringing the bell.</p>

<p>"Has the person from England arrived?" he asked the servant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She came a quarter of an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Ask her to come here at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, Martin, you have not sent for a hospital nurse, I hope," cried
Isola, excitedly. "Indeed I am not so bad as that. I want very little
help. I could not bear to have a stranger about me."</p>

<p>"This is not a stranger, Isola."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>There came a modest knock at the door as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said; and a familiar figure in a grey merino gown and
smart white cap with pink ribbons entered quietly and came to the sofa
where Isola was lying.</p>

<p>"Tabitha!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Don't say you're sorry to see an old face again, Mrs. Disney. I told
Mr. Martin that if you should ever be ill and want nursing I'd come to
nurse you&mdash;if you were at the other end of the world&mdash;and Mr. Martin
wrote and told me you wanted an old servant's care and experience to
get you over your illness&mdash;and here I am. I've come every inch of the
way without stopping, except at the buffets, and all I can say is Rome
is a long way from everywhere, and the country I've come through isn't
to be compared with Cornwall."</p>

<p>She ran on breathlessly as she seated herself by that reclining figure
with the waxen face. It may be that she talked to hide the shock she
had experienced on seeing the altered looks of the young mistress whose
roof she had left in the hour of shame. She had left her, refusing to
hold commune with one who had sinned so deeply. The faithful servant
had taken leave of her mistress in words that had eaten into Isola's
heart, as if they had been written there with a corrosive acid.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for you, Mrs. Disney," she said. "You are young and
pretty, and you are very much to be pitied&mdash;and God knows I have loved
you as if you were my own flesh and blood. But I won't stay under the
roof of a wife who has brought shame upon herself and has dishonoured
the best of husbands."</p>

<p>Isola had denied nothing, had acknowledged nothing, and had let Tabitha
go. And now they met again for the first time after that miserable
parting, and the servant's eyes were full of pitying tears, and the
servant's lips spoke only gentlest words. What a virtue there must be
in death, when so much is forgiven to the dying!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Martin Disney went out with the priest, but at the corner of the Piazza
he stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"Isola's coughing fit has upset me more than it has her," he said; "I'm
not fit company for any one, so I think I'll go for a tramp somewhere,
and meet you later at dinner, when I've recovered my spirits a little."</p>

<p>"<i>A riverderci</i>," said the priest, grasping his hand. "I felicitate you
upon this day's union; a happy one, or I am no judge of men and women."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Disney answered gloomily. "The woman is true as
steel&mdash;the man comes of a bad stock. You know what the Scripture says
about the tree and the fruit."</p>

<p>"There never was a race yet that was altogether bad," said the priest.
"Virtues may descend from remote ancestors as well as vices,&mdash;I think
you told me moreover that Captain Hulbert's mother was a good woman."</p>

<p>"She was. She was one of my mother's earliest and dearest friends."</p>

<p>"Then you should have a better opinion of her son. If ever I met a
thoroughly good fellow in my life, I believe I met one the day I made
Captain Hulbert's acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Pray God you may be right," said Disney, with a sigh. "I am no judge
of character."</p>

<p>He turned abruptly, and skirted the hill on his way to the gardens of
the Villa Borghese, where he found shade and seclusion in the early
afternoon. The carriages of fashionable Rome had not yet begun to drive
in at the gate. The cypress avenues, the groves of immemorial ilex,
the verdant lawns where the fountains leapt sunward, were peopled only
by creatures of fable, fixed in marble, faun and dryad, hero and god.
Martin Disney plunged into the shadow of one of those funereal avenues,
and&mdash;while the sun blazed in almost tropical splendour upon the open
lawn in the far distance&mdash;he walked as it were in the deep of night, a
night whose gloom harmonized with that darker night in his despairing
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Great God, how he had loved her! How he had looked up to her, revering
even her weakness as the expression of a childlike purity. And while he
had been praying for her, and dreaming of her, and longing for her, and
thinking of her as the very type of womanly chastity, unapproachable
by temptation, unassailable, secure in her innocence and simplicity
as Athene or Artemis with all their armour of defence; while he had
so loved and trusted her, she had flung herself into the arms of a
profligate&mdash;as easily won as the lightest wanton. She had done this
thing, and then she had welcomed him, with wan, sweet smiles, to his
dishonoured home. She had made him drink the cup of shame&mdash;a by-word
it might be for the whole parish, as well as for that one man who
had dared to hint at evil. And yet he had forgiven her&mdash;forgiven one
to whom pardon meant only a peaceful ending; forgiven as a man holds
himself forgiven by an all-merciful God, as he hears words of pity and
promise murmured into his ear by the priest upon the scaffold, when
the rope is round his neck and the drop is ready to fall. How could
he withhold such pardon when he had been taught that God forgives the
repentant murderer?</p>

<p class="center">"THOUGH LOVE AND LIFE AND DEATH SHOULD COME AND GO."</p>


<p>Isola was alone in the spacious Roman drawing-room, its wide windows
open to the soft, warm air. The sun was off that side of the house
now, and the Venetian shutters had been pushed back; and between the
heavy stone pillars of the loggia she saw the orange and magnolia trees
in the garden, and the pale gold of the mimosas beyond. The sun was
shining full upon the Hill of Gardens, that hill at whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> foot Nero
was buried in secret at dead of night by his faithful freedman and the
devoted woman who loved him to the shameful end of the shameful life;
that hill whose antique groves the wicked Cæsar's ghost had once made a
place of terror. The wicked ghost was laid now. Modern civilization had
sent Nero the way of all phantoms; and fashionable Rome made holiday on
the Hill of Gardens. A military band was playing there this afternoon
in the golden light, and the familiar melodies in Don Giovanni were
wafted ever and anon in little gusts of sweetness to the loggia where
the vivid crimson of waxen camelias and the softer rose of oleander
blossoms gave brightness and colour to the dark foliage and the cold
white stone.</p>

<p>Isola heard those far-off melodies faint in the distance&mdash;heard without
heeding. The notes were beyond measure familiar, interwoven with the
very fabric of her life, for those were the airs Martin Disney loved,
and she had played them to him nearly every evening in their quiet,
monotonous life. She heard, unheeding, for her thoughts had wandered
back to the night of the ball at Lostwithiel and all that went after
it&mdash;the fatal night that struck the death-knell of peace and innocence.</p>

<p>How vividly she remembered every detail&mdash;her fluttering apprehensions
during the long drive on the dark road, up hill and down hill; her
eagerness for the delight of the dance, as an unaccustomed pleasure&mdash;a
scene to which young beauty flies as the moth to the flame; her
remorseful consciousness that she had done wrong in yielding to the
temptation which drew her there; the longing to see Lostwithiel once
more&mdash;Lostwithiel, whom she had vowed to herself never to meet again of
her own free will. She had gone home that afternoon resolved to forego
the ball, to make any social sacrifice rather than look upon that man
whose burning words of love, breathed in her ear before she had enough
of nerve or calmness to silence him, had left her scathed and geared
as if the lightning had blasted her. She had heard his avowal. There
was no room now to doubt the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> of all that had gone before, no
ground now for believing in a tender, platonic admiration, lapping her
round with its soft radiance&mdash;a light, but not a fire. That which had
burnt into her soul to-day was the fierce flame of a dishonouring love,
the bold avowal of a lover who wanted to steal her from her husband,
and make her a sinner before her God.</p>

<p>She knew this much&mdash;had brooded upon it all the evening&mdash;and yet she
was going to a place where she must inevitably meet the Tempter.</p>

<p>She was going because it was expedient to go; because her persistent
refusal to be there might give rise to guesses and suspicions that
would lead to a discovery of the real reason of her absence. She
had often seen the subtle process, the society search-light by
which Trelasco and Fowey could arrive at the innermost working of a
neighbour's heart, the deepest mysteries of motive.</p>

<p>She was going to the ball after all, fevered, anxious, full of dim
forebodings; and yet with an eager expectancy; and yet with a strange
over-mastering joy. How should she meet him? How could she avoid
him, without ostentatious avoidance, knowing how many eyes would be
quick to mark any deviation from conventional behaviour? Somehow or
other she was resolved to avoid all association with him; to get her
programme filled before he could ask her to dance; or to refuse in any
case if he asked her. He would scarcely venture to approach her after
what had been said in the lane, when her indignation had been plainly
expressed with angry tears. No, he would hardly dare. And so&mdash;in a
vague bewilderment at finding she was at her journey's end&mdash;she saw the
lights of the little town close upon her, and in the next few minutes
her carriage was moving slowly in the rank of carriages setting down
their freight at the door of the inn.</p>

<p>Vaguely, as in a dream, she saw the lights and the flowers, the satin
gowns and the diamonds, the scarlet and white upon the walls, brush
and vizard, vizard and brush. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> was not there. She looked along the
crowd, and that tall figure and that dark head were absent. She ought
to have been glad at this respite, and yet her heart grew heavy as lead.</p>

<p>Later he was there, and she was waltzing with him. At the last moment
when he was standing before her, cool, self-possessed, as it were
unconscious of that burning past, she had no more power to refuse to
be his partner than the bird has to escape from the snake. She had
given him her hand, and they were moving slowly, softly to the music
of the soft, slow waltz. Myosotis, myosotis&mdash;mystic flower which means
everlasting remembrance! Would she ever forget this night? Their
last meeting&mdash;safest possible meeting-place here in the shine of the
lamps&mdash;in the sight of the multitude. Here she could so easily hold him
at a distance. Here she might speak to him lightly, as if she too were
unconscious of the past. Here she was safe against his madness and her
own weak unstable heart, which fluttered at his smallest word.</p>

<p>And so the night wore on, and she danced with him more times than she
could count, forgetting, or pretending to forget, other engagements;
going through an occasional waltz with another partner just for
propriety's sake, and hardly knowing who that partner was; knowing so
well that there was some one else standing against the wall, watching
her every movement, with the love-light in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then came the period after supper when they sat in the ante-room and
let the dances go by, hearing the music of waltzes which they were to
have danced together, hearing and heeding not. And then came a sudden
scare at the thought of the hour. Was it late?</p>

<p>Late, very late!</p>

<p>The discovery fluttered and unnerved her, and she was scarcely able to
collect her thoughts as he handed her into the carriage and shut the
door.</p>

<p>"Surely it was a grey horse that brought me!" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> exclaimed, and
in the next minute she recognized Lostwithiel's brougham, the same
carriage in which she had been driven home through the rain upon that
unforgotten night when his house sheltered her, when she saw his face
for the first time.</p>

<p>Yes, it was his carriage. She knew the colour of the lining, the little
brass clock, the reading-lamp, the black panther rug. She pulled at the
check-string, but without effect. The carriage drove on, slowly, but
steadily, to the end of the town. She let down the window and called to
the coachman. There was only one man on the box, and he took no notice
of her call.</p>

<p>Yes, he had heard, perhaps, for he drew up his horse suddenly by the
road-side, a little way beyond the town. A man opened the door and
sprang in, breathless after running. It was Lostwithiel.</p>

<p>"You put me into your carriage!" she cried distractedly. "How could you
make such a mistake? Pray tell him to go back to the inn directly."</p>

<p>They were driving along the country road at a rapid pace, and he had
seated himself by her side, clasping her hand. He pulled up the window
nearest her, and prevented her calling to the coachman.</p>

<p>"Why should you go back? You will be home sooner with my horse than
with the screw that brought you."</p>

<p>"But the fly will be waiting for me&mdash;the man will wonder."</p>

<p>"Let him wonder. He won't wait very long, you may be assured. He will
guess what has happened. In the confusion of carriages you took the
wrong one. Isola, I am going to leave Cornwall to-night&mdash;to leave
England&mdash;perhaps never to return. Give me the last few moments of my
life here. Be merciful to me. I am going away&mdash;perhaps for ever."</p>

<p>"Take me home," she said. "Are you really taking home? Is this the
right way?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course it is the right way. Do you suppose I am going to drive you
to London?"</p>

<p>He let down the glass suddenly, and pointed into the night.</p>

<p>"Isola, do you see where we are? There's the sign-post at the cross
roads. There's the tower of Tywardreath Church, though you can hardly
see it in this dim light. Are you satisfied now?"</p>

<p>He had drawn up the glass again. The windows were clouded by the mist
of their mingled breath; the atmosphere was faint with the odour of the
faded chrysanthemums on her gown and the carnation in the lapel of his
coat. All that she could see of the outer world was the blurred light
of the carriage lamps. The high-spirited horse was going up and down
the hills at a perilous pace. At this rate the journey could not take
long.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;and then&mdash;he came back to the prayer he had breathed in her
ear more than twelve hours ago in the wintry lane. He loved her, he
loved her, he loved her! Could she refuse to go away with him&mdash;having
woven herself into his life, having made him madly, helplessly in love
with her? Could she refuse? Had any woman the right to refuse? He
appealed to her sense of honour. She had gone too far&mdash;she had granted
too much already, granting him her love. She was in his arms in the dim
light, in the faint, dream-like atmosphere. He was taking possession of
her weak heart by all that science of love in which he was past master.
Honour, conscience, fidelity to the absent, piety, innocence were being
swept away in that lava flood of passion. Helpless, irresolute, she
faltered again and again. "Take me home, Lostwithiel! Have mercy! Take
me home."</p>

<p>He stopped those tremulous lips with a kiss&mdash;the kiss that betrays. The
carriage dashed down a steep bill, rattled along a street so narrow
that the wheels seemed to grind against the house-fronts on each side,
down hill again, and then the horse was pulled up suddenly in a stony
square, and the door opened, and the soft, fresh sea-breeze blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> among
her loosened hair, and upon her uncovered neck, and she heard the
gentle plish-plash of a boat moored against the quay at her feet.</p>

<p>"This is not home!" she cried piteously.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is home, love, our home for a little while&mdash;the home that can
carry us to the other end of the world, if you will."</p>

<p>The quay, and the water, and the few faint lights here and there grew
dark, and she knew no more, till she heard the sailors crying, "Yeo,
heave, yeo," and the heavy sails flapping, and the creak of the boom as
it swayed in the wind, and felt the dancing motion of the boat as she
cut her way through the waves, felt the strong arm that clasped her,
and heard the low, fond voice that murmured in her ear, "Isola, Isola,
forgive me! I could not live without you."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That which came afterwards had seemed one long and lurid dream&mdash;a
dream of fair weather and foul; of peril and despair; of passionate,
all-conquering love.</p>

<p>To-day, as she lay supine in the afternoon silence&mdash;lying as Tabitha
had left her, in a fevered sleep&mdash;the vision of that past came back
upon her in all its vivid colouring, almost as distinctly as it had
re-acted itself in her hours of delirium, when she had lived that
tragic chapter of her life over again, and had felt the fury of the
waves and breathed the chill, salt air of the tempest-driven sea, and
had seen the moon riding high amidst the cloud-chaos&mdash;now appearing,
now vanishing, as if she too were a storm-driven bark in a raging sea.</p>

<p>Oh God! how vividly those hours came back! The awful progress from
Ushant to Arcachon; the darkness of the brief day; the horror of the
long night; the shuddering yacht, with straining spars, and broadside
beaten by a heaving mass of water, that struck her with the force of a
thousand battering-rams, blow after blow, each blow seeming as if the
next must always be the last&mdash;the final crash and end of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> things.
The pretty, dainty vessel, long and narrow, rode like an eggshell on
those furious waters&mdash;here a long wall of inky blackness, rising like a
mountain-ridge, and bearing down on the doomed ship, and beyond, as far
as the eye could reach, a waste of surf, livid in the moonlight. What
helpless insignificance, as of a leaf tossed on a whirlpool, when that
mountainous mass took the yacht and lifted her on cyclopean shoulders,
and shook her off again into the black trough of the sea, as into the
depths of hell! And this not once only, nor a hundred times only, but
on through that endless-seeming night, on in the sickly winter dawn
and in the faint yellow gleam of a rainy noontide&mdash;on through day that
seemed mixed and entangled with night, as if the beginning of creation
had come round again, and the light were not yet divided from the
darkness.</p>

<p>Oh, those passionate, never-to-be-forgotten moments, when she had
stood with him at the top of the companion, looking out upon those
livid waters; fondly believing that each moment was to be their last;
that the gates of death were opening yonder&mdash;a watery way, a gulf to
which they must go down, in a moment, in a little moment, in a flash,
in a breath, at the next, or the next, or the next mad plunge of that
hurrying bark. Yes, death was there, in front of them&mdash;inevitable,
imminent, immediate&mdash;and life and sin, shame, remorse, were done with,
along with the years that lay behind them, a page blotted and blurred
with one passionate madness, which had changed the colour of a woman's
life. She knew not how she bore up against the force of that tempest;
clinging to him with her bare, wet arms; held up by him; crouching
against the woodwork, which shook and rattled with every blow of the
battering-rams. She only knew that his arms were round her, that she
was safe with him, even when the leaping surf rose high above her head,
wrapping her round like a mantle, blinding, drowning her in a momentary
extinction. She only knew that his lips were close to her ear, and that
in a momentary lull of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> awful voices he murmured, "We are going
to die, Isola! The boat cannot live through such a storm! We shall go
down to death together!" And her lips turned to him with a joyful cry,
"Thank God!" Then again, in a minute's interval, he pleaded, "Forgive
me, love; my stolen love, forgive me before we did!" And again, "Was it
a crime, Isola?" "If it was, I forgive you!" she whispered, clinging to
him as the blast struck them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cruel revulsion of feeling, bitter irony of Fate, when the great grim
waves&mdash;which had seemed like living monsters hurrying down upon them
with malignant fury to tear and to devour&mdash;when the awful sea began to
roar with a lesser voice, and the thunder of the battering-rams had
a duller sound, and the bows of the yacht no longer plunged straight
down into the leaden-coloured pit; no longer climbed those inky ridges
with such blind impetus, as of a cockle-shell in a whirlpool. Bitter
sense of loss and dismay when the grey, cold dawn lighted a quieter
sea, and she heard the captain telling Lostwithiel that they had seen
the worst of the storm, and that there was no fear now. He was going to
put on more canvas: and hadn't the lady better go below, where it was
warm. She needn't feel anyway nervous now. They would soon be in the
roadstead of Arcachon.</p>

<p>She had not felt the chill change from night to morning. She had not
felt the surf that drenched her loose, entangled hair. She hardly know
when or how Lostwithiel had wrapped her in his fur-lined coat; but
she found that she was so enveloped presently when she stumbled and
staggered down to the cabin, and flung herself face downward upon the
sofa, in a paroxysm of impotent despair.</p>

<p>Death would have delivered her. The tempest was her friend; and the
tempest had passed her by, and left her lying there like a weed, more
worthless than any weed that over the sea cast up to rot upon the
barren rocks. Yes, she was left there; left in a life that sin had
blighted; loathsome to herself, hateful to her God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>She locked herself in the cabin, while the hurrying footsteps overhead
told her that Lostwithiel was working with the sailors.</p>

<p>An hour later, and he was at the cabin door, pleading for one kind
word, entreating her to let him see her, were it only for a few
moments, to know that she was not utterly broken down by the peril she
had passed through. He pleaded in vain. She would give no answer&mdash;she
would speak no word. Indeed, in that dull agony of shame and despair
it seemed to her as if a dumb devil had entered into her. Her parched
lips seemed to have lost the power of speech. She lay there, staring
straight before her at all the swinging things on the cedar panel&mdash;the
books and photographs&mdash;and lamps and frivolities, vibrating with
every movement of the sea. Her hands were clenched until the nails
cut into the flesh. Her heart was throbbing with a dull, slow beat
that made itself torturingly audible. Did God create His creatures
for such agony? Had she been foredoomed everlastingly&mdash;in that awful
incomprehensible ante-natal Eternity&mdash;foredoomed to this fallen state,
to this unutterable shame?</p>

<p>Hours went by, she knew not how. Again and again Lostwithiel came to
her door, and talked and entreated&mdash;Heaven knows how tenderly&mdash;with
what deep contrition, with what fond pleading for pardon. But the dumb
devil held her still. She wrapped herself in a sullen despair&mdash;not
anger, for anger is active. Hers was only a supine resistance.</p>

<p>At last she heard him come with one of the sailors, and she could make
out from their whispering talk that they were going to force open the
door. Then she started up in a fury, and went and flung herself against
the cedar panels.</p>

<p>"If you don't leave me alone in my misery I will kill myself!" she
cried.</p>

<p>The long night was over; and the sun was high. It seemed as if they
were sailing over a summer sea, and through the scuttle port she saw a
little foreign town nestling under the shelter of pine-clad hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>She woke from brief and troubled slumbers to see this smiling shore,
and at first she fancied they must have sailed back to Cornwall, and
that this was some unknown bay upon that rock-bound coast; but the
sapphire sea and the summer-like sunshine suggested a fairer clime than
rugged Britain.</p>

<p>While she was looking out at the crescent-shaped bay, and the long
line of white villas, the anchor was being lowered. The sea was almost
as smooth as a lake, and those tranquil waters had the colour and the
sheen of sapphire and emerald. She thought of the jasper sea&mdash;the
sea of the Apocalypse, the tideless sea beside that land of the New
Jerusalem where there are no more tears, where there can be no more
sin, a city of ransomed souls, redeemed from all earth's iniquity.</p>

<p>A boat was being lowered. She heard the scroop of the ropes in the
davits; she heard footsteps on the accommodation-ladder, and then
the dip of oars, and presently the boat passed between her and the
sunlit waters, and she saw Lostwithiel sitting in the stern, with the
rudder-lines in his hands, while two sailors were bending to their
oars, with wind-blown hair and cheery, smiling faces, broad and red in
the gay morning sunshine.</p>

<p>He was gone, and she breathed more freely. There was a sense of release
in his absence; and for the first time she looked round the cabin,
where beautiful and luxurious things lay, thrown here and there in
huddled masses of brilliant colour. A Japanese screen, a masterpiece
of rainbow-hued embroidery on a sea-green ground, flung against the
panelling at one end&mdash;Persian curtains wrenched from their fastenings
and hanging awry&mdash;satin pillows that had drifted into a heap in one
corner&mdash;signs of havoc everywhere. She stood in the midst of all this
ruin, and looked at her own reflection in a Venetian glass riveted to
the panelling, about the only object that had held its place through
the storm.</p>

<p>Her own reflection. Was that really herself, that ghastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> image which
the glass gave back to her? The reflection of a woman with livid cheeks
and blanched lips, with swollen eyelids, and dark rings of purple round
the haggard eyes, and hair rough and tangled as Medusa's locks, and
bare shoulders from which the stained satin bodice had slipped away.
Her wedding-gown! Could that defiled garment&mdash;the long folds of the
once shining satin, draggled and dripping with sea-water&mdash;could these
tawdry rags be the wedding-gown she had put on in her proud and happy
innocence in the old bedroom at Dinan, with mother, and servants, and a
useful friend or two helping and hindering?</p>

<p>Oh, if they could see her now, those old friends of her unclouded
childhood, the mother and father who had loved and trusted her, who had
never spoken of evil things in her hearing, had never thought that sin
could come near her! And she had fallen like the lowest of womankind.
She had forfeited her place among the virtuous and happy for ever. She,
Martin Disney's wife! That good man, that brave soldier who had fought
for Queen and country&mdash;it was his wife who stood there in her shame,
haggard and dishevelled!</p>

<p>She flung her arms above her head and wrung her hands in a paroxysm
of despair. Then, with a little cry, she plucked at the loose wild
tresses as if she would have torn them from her head; and then she
threw herself upon the cabin floor in her agony, and grovelled there, a
creature for whom death would have been a merciful release.</p>

<p>"If I could die&mdash;if I could but die, and no one know!" she moaned.</p>

<p>She lifted herself up again upon her knees, and, with one hand upon
the floor, looked round the walls of the cabin&mdash;looked at a trophy
of Moorish and Italian arms which decorated the panelling, searching
for some sharp dagger with which she might take her hated life. And
then came the thought of what must follow death, not for her in
the dim incomprehensible eternity, but for those who loved her on
earth, for those who would have to be told how she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> been found,
in her draggled wedding-gown, stabbed by her own hand on board Lord
Lostwithiel's yacht. What a story of shame and crime for newspapers
to embellish, and for scandal-lovers to gloat over! No! She dared not
destroy herself thus. She must collect her senses, escape from her
seducer, and keep the secret of her dishonour.</p>

<p>She took off her gown, and rolled train and bodice into a bundle as
small as she could make them. Then she looked about the cabin for some
object with which to weight her bundle. Yes, that would do. A little
brass dolphin that was used to steady the open door. That was heavy
enough, perhaps. She put it into the middle of her bundle, tied a
ribbon tightly round the whole, and then she opened the scuttle port
and dropped her wedding-garment into the sea. The keen fresh wind, the
wind from pine-clad hills and distant snow mountains, blew in upon
her bare neck and chilled her; but it helped to cool the fever of her
mind, and she sat down and leant her head upon her clasped hands, and
tried to think what she must do to free herself from the toils in which
guilty love had caught her.</p>

<p>She must escape from the yacht. She must go back to England&mdash;somehow.</p>

<p>She thought that if she were to appeal to Lostwithiel's honour
some spark of better feeling would prevail over that madness which
had wrecked her, and he would let her go, he would take her back
to England, and facilitate her secret return to the home she had
dishonoured. But could she trust herself to make that appeal? Could
she stand fast against his pleading, if he implored her to stay with
him, to live the life that he had planned for her, the life that he had
painted so eloquently, the dreamy, beautiful life amidst earth's most
romantic scenes, the life of love in idleness? Could she resist him
if he should plead&mdash;it might be with tears&mdash;he, whom she adored, her
destroyer and her divinity? No, she must leave the yacht before he came
back to her. But how?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>There were only men on board. There was no woman to whose compassion
she could appeal, no woman to lend her clothes to cover her. She
saw herself once again in the Venetian glass, in her long trained
petticoat of muslin and lace, so daintily fresh when she dressed for
the ball&mdash;muslin and lace soddened by the sea, torn to shreds where
her feet had caught in the flounces as she stumbled down the companion
during last night's storm. A fitting costume in which to travel from
Arcachon to London, verily! She opened a door leading to an inner
cabin, which contained bed and bath, and all toilet appliances. Hanging
against the wall there were three dressing-gowns, the lightest and
least masculine of the three being a robe of Indian camel's hair,
embroidered with gray silk&mdash;a shapeless garment with loose sleeves and
a girdle.</p>

<p>Here, within locked doors, she made her hurried toilet, with much cold
water. She brushed her long, ragged hair with one of the humblest of
the brushes. She would not take so much as a few drops from the great
crystal bottle of eau de Cologne which was held in a silver frame
suspended from the ceiling. Nothing of his would she touch, nothing
belonging to the man who wanted to pour his fortune into her lap, to
make his life her life, his estate her estate, his name her name, could
she but survive the ordeal of the divorce court, and shake off old ties.</p>

<p>She rolled her hair in a large coil at the back of her head. She put
on the camel's hair dressing-gown, and tied the girdle round her long,
slim waist, and having done this she looked altogether a different
creature from that vision of haggard shame which she had seen just
now with loathing. She had a curious Puritan air in her sad coloured
raiment, and braided hair.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she finished when she heard the dip of oars, and looking
out in an agony of horror at the apprehension of Lostwithiel's return,
she saw a boat laden with two big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> milliner's baskets, and with a woman
sitting in the stem. The men who were rowing this boat were not of the
crew of the <i>Vendetta</i>.</p>

<p>She had not long to wonder. She unlocked her door, and went into the
adjoining cabin, while the boat came alongside, and woman and baskets
were hauled upon the deck.</p>

<p>Three minutes afterwards the cabin-boy knocked at her door, and told
her that there was a person from Arcachon to see her, a dressmaker with
things that had been ordered for her.</p>

<p>She unlocked the door, for the first time since she locked it at dawn,
and found herself face to face with a smiling young person, whose black
eyes and olive complexion were warm with the glow of the south, golden
in the eyes, carnation on the plump, oval cheeks.</p>

<p>This young person had the honour to bring the trousseau which Monsieur
had sent for Madame's inspection. Monsieur had told her how sadly
inconvenienced Madame had been by the accident by which all her luggage
had been left upon the quay at the moment of sailing. In truth it must
have been distressing for Madame, as it had evidently been distressing
for Monsieur in his profound sympathy with Madame, his wife. In the
meantime she, the young person, had complied with Monsieur's orders,
and had brought all that there was of the best and most delicate and
refined for Madame's gracious inspection.</p>

<p>The cabin-boy brought in the two baskets, which the milliner opened
with an air, taking out the delicate lingerie, the soft silk and softer
cashmere&mdash;peignoirs, frilled petticoats, a fluff and flutter of creamy
lace and pale satin ribbons, transforming simplest garments into things
of beauty. She spread out her wares, chattering all the while, and then
looked at Madame for approval.</p>

<p>Isola scarcely glanced at all the finery. She pointed to the only
plain walking-gown among all the delicate prettinesses, the silks and
cashmeres and laces&mdash;a grey tweed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> tailor-gown, with no adornment
except a little narrow black braid.</p>

<p>"I will keep that," she said, "and one set of under-linen, the
plainest. You can take all the rest of the things back to your shop.
Please help me to dress as quickly as you can&mdash;I want to go on shore in
the boat that takes you back."</p>

<p>"But, Madame, Monsieur insisted that I should bring a complete
trousseau. He wished Madame to supply herself with all things needful
for a long cruise in the south."</p>

<p>"He was mistaken. My luggage is safe enough. I shall have it again in a
few days. I only want clothes to wear for a day or two. Kindly do what
I ask."</p>

<p>Her tone was so authoritative that the milliner complied, reluctantly,
and murmuring persuasive little speeches while she assisted Madame to
dress. All that she had brought was of the most new&mdash;expressly arrived
from Paris, from one of the most distinguished establishments in the
Rue de la Paix. Fashions change so quickly&mdash;and the present fashions
were so enchanting, so original. She must be pardoned if she suggested
that nothing in Madame's wardrobe could be so new or so elegant as
these latest triumphs of an artistic <i>faiseur</i>. Madame took no heed of
her eloquence, but hurried through the simple toilet, insisted upon all
the finery being replaced in the two baskets, and then went upon deck
with the milliner.</p>

<p>"I am going on shore to his lordship," she said, with quiet authority,
to the captain.</p>

<p>It was a deliberate lie&mdash;the first she had told, but not the last she
would have to tell.</p>

<p>She landed on the beach at Arcachon&mdash;penniless, but with a diamond
ring on her wedding finger&mdash;her engagement ring&mdash;which she knew, by a
careless admission of Martin Disney's, to have cost fifty pounds. She
left the milliner, and went into the little town, dreading to meet
Lostwithiel at every step. She found a complacent jeweller who was
willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> advance twenty-five Napoleons upon the ring, and promised
to return it to her on the receipt of that sum, with only a bagatelle
of twenty francs for interest, since Madame would redeem her pledge
almost immediately.</p>

<p>Furnished with this money she drove straight to the station, and waited
there in the most obscure corner she could find till the first train
left for Bordeaux. At Bordeaux she had a long time to wait, still in
hiding, before the express left for Paris&mdash;and then came the long,
lonely journey&mdash;from Bordeaux to Paris&mdash;from Paris to London&mdash;from
London to Trelasco. It seemed an endless pilgrimage, a nightmare dream
of dark night and wintry day, made hideous by the ceaseless throb of
the engine, the perpetual odour of sulphur and smoke. She reached
Trelasco somehow, and sank exhausted in Tabitha's arms.</p>

<p>"What day is it?" she asked faintly, looking round the familiar room,
as if she had never seen it before.</p>

<p>"Thursday, ma'am. You have been away ten days," the old servant
answered coldly.</p>

<p>It was only the next day that Tabitha told her mistress she must leave
her.</p>

<p>"There is no need to talk about what has happened," she said. "I have
kept your secret. I have let no one know that you were away. I packed
Susan off for a holiday the morning after the ball. I don't believe any
one knows anything about you&mdash;unless you were seen yesterday on your
way home."</p>

<p>Then came stern words of renunciation, a conscientious but rather
narrow-minded woman's protest against sin.</p>

<p class="center">"I, YOU, AND GOD CAN COMPREHEND EACH OTHER."</p>


<p>It was two months after Allegra's wedding-day, and Martin Disney had
been warned that the closing hour of the young life he had watched so
tenderly was not far off. It might come to-morrow; or it might not come
for a week; or the lingering flame might go flickering on, fainting
and reviving in the socket, for another month. He must hold himself
prepared for the worst. Death might come suddenly at the last, like a
thief in the night; or by stealthy, gradual steps, and slowest progress
from life to clay.</p>

<p>He sat beside Isola's sofa in the Roman lodging as he had sat beside
her bed in that long illness at Trelasco, when her wandering mind
appalled him more than her bodily weakness. He watched as faithfully as
he had watched then, but this time without hope.</p>

<p>Father Rodwell had been with her at seven o'clock upon the last three
mornings, and had administered the sacrament to her and to her husband,
and to the faithful Tabitha, one with them in piety and love. The
priest thought that each celebration would be the last; but she rallied
a little as the day wore on, and lived till sunset; lived through the
long painful night; and another day dawned, and he found her waiting
for him in the morning, ready to greet him with her pale smile when he
appeared upon the threshold of her room, after going up the staircase
in saddest apprehension, dreading to hear that all was over, except the
funeral service and the funeral bell.</p>

<p>She insisted upon getting up and going into the drawing-room, feeble
as she was. Tabitha was so handy and so helpful that the fatigue of
an invalid's toilet was lightened to the uttermost. Tabitha and the
colonel carried her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> from the bedroom to the drawing-room upon her
couch, and carried the couch back to the bedside in the evening. Before
noon she was lying in the sunlit salon, surrounded with flowers and
photographs and books and newspapers, and all things that lighten the
monotonous hours of sickness.</p>

<p>Nor was companionship ever wanting. Martin Disney devoted himself to
her with an unfailing patience. Upon no pretence would he leave her for
more than half an hour at a time&mdash;-just the space of a walk to the Hill
of Gardens, or the length of the Via de' Condotti and the Corso; just
the space of a cigar in the loggia.</p>

<p>He read to her, he talked to her, he waited upon her. Tabitha and
he were her only nurses; for Löttchen was a young woman of profound
concentration of motive, and had early taken unto herself the motto,
One baby, one nurse. She conscientiously performed her duty to her
infant charge; but she rarely lifted a finger to help any one else.</p>

<p>It was drawing towards the end of July; the weather had been lovely
hitherto&mdash;hot, and very hot, but not insupportable for those who
could afford to dawdle and sleep away their mid-day and afternoon
existence&mdash;who had horses to carry them about in the early mornings,
and a carriage to drive them in moonlit gardens and picturesque places.
In the suburbs of the great city, across the arid Campagna yonder,
at Tivoli, and Frascati, and Albano, and Castel Gandolfo, people had
been revelling in the summer, living under Jove's broad roof, with
dancing and sports, and music and feasting, and rustic, innocent
kisses, snatched amidst the darkness of groves whose only lamps are
fireflies&mdash;deep woods of ilex, where the nightingale sings long and
late, and the grasshopper trills his good night through the perfumed
herbage.</p>

<p>Here, in Rome, the heat was more oppressive, and the splashing of the
city's many fountains was the only relief from the glare and dazzle of
the piazzas, the whiteness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> great blocks of houses in the new
streets and boulevards. Blinds were lowered, and shops were shut, in
the blinding noontide heat, and through the early afternoon the eternal
city was almost as silent and reposeful as the sleeping beauty&mdash;to
awaken at sundown to movement, and life, and music, and singing, in
lighted streets and crowded cafes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the dim grey of the morning, the slumberous calm of summer
changed to howling wind and tropical rain&mdash;torrential rain, that
filled every gutter, and splashed from every housetop, and ran in wild
cascades from every alley on the steep hillsides. The Campagna was one
vast lake, illumined with flashes of lightning, and the thunder pealed
and reverberated along the lofty parapets of the ruined aqueducts. The
tall cypresses in the Pincian Gardens bent like saplings before that
mighty wind, which seemed to howl and shriek its loudest as it came
tearing down from the hill to whistle and rave among the housetops in
the Piazza di Spagna.</p>

<p>"One would think the ghost of Nero were shrieking in the midst of the
tempest," said Isola, as she listened to the fitful sobbing of the wind
late in the dull grey afternoon, while her husband and Father Rodwell
sat near her couch, keeping up that sad pretence of cheerfulness
which love struggles to maintain upon the very edge of the grave&mdash;the
brokenhearted make-believe of those who know that death waits at the
door. "There comes a shrill cry every now and then like the scream of a
wicked spirit in pain."</p>

<p>"Rome is full of ghosts," answered the priest, "but there are the
shadows of the good and the great as well as of the wicked. Walking
alone in twilight on the Aventine, I should hardly be surprised to meet
the spirit of Gregory the Great wandering amidst the scenes of his
saintly life; nor do I ever go into the Pantheon at dusk without half
expecting to see the shade of Raffaelle. And there are others&mdash;some
I knew in the flesh&mdash;Wiseman and Antonelli, Gibson, the sculptor,
consummate artist and gentlest of men&mdash;yes, Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> is full of the
shadows of the good and the wise. One can afford to put up with Nero."</p>

<p>"You don't mean me to think that you believe in ghosts?" asked Isola,
deeply interested.</p>

<p>It was only five o'clock, yet the sky was grey with the greyness of
late evening. Here in this land of sunshine there had been all day long
the brooding gloom of storm-clouds, and a sky that was dark as winter.</p>

<p>"I won't analyze my own feelings on the subject; I will quote the
words of a man at whose feet it was my happiness to sit sometimes
when I was a lad at Oxford. Canon Mozley has not shrunk from facing
the great problem of spiritual life in this world&mdash;of an invisible
after-existence upon the earth when the body is dust. 'Is the mother
of our Lord now existing?' he asks, and answers, 'Yes. I believe that
all fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters are now existing. Nature has
disposed of their bodies as far as we can trace her work; but their
souls remain. So I read in Homer, in Virgil, and in the New Testament.
This existence I am permitted to believe is a conscious and active
existence.' Canon Mozley, the man who wrote those words, and much more
in the same strain, was not an idle visionary. If he could afford to
believe in the presence of the dead among us, why, so can I. And I
believe that Gregory the Great has whispered at the ear of many a Holy
Father in the long line of his successors, and has influenced many a
Cardinal's vote, and has been an invisible power in many a council."</p>

<p>"I like to believe in ghosts," said Isola, gently. "But I thank God
those that I love are still in this life."</p>

<p>She held out her hand with a curiously timid gesture to her husband,
who clasped it tenderly, bending his lips to kiss the pale thin
fingers. Oh, Death, pity and pardon are so interwoven with thine image
that neither pride nor anger has any force against thy softening
influence. She had been false. She had wronged him and dishonoured
herself, cruelly, cruelly, most cruelly; but she had suffered and
repented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> and she was passing away from him. Let the broken spirit
pass in peace!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That day wore itself out in storm and tempest, and the night came
on like a fierce death-struggle; and the wind raved and shrieked
at intervals all through the night; and again next day there were
gloom and darkness, and a sky heaped up with masses of lead-coloured
cloud; and again the torrential rain streamed from the housetops and
splashed in the streets below; a dreary day to be endured even by the
healthy and the happy&mdash;a day of painful oppression for an invalid.
Isola's spirits sank to the lowest depth, and for the first time since
Allegra's marriage she talked hopelessly of their separation.</p>

<p>"If I could only see her once more before I die," she sighed.</p>

<p>"My dear love, you shall see her as soon as the railway can bring her
here. Remember, it is you who have forbidden me to send for her. You
know how dearly she loves you&mdash;how willingly she would come to you.
I'll telegraph to her within half an hour."</p>

<p>"No, no, no," Isola protested hurriedly. "No, we can never meet again
in this world. I took my farewell of her in the church. I meant it
to be farewell. I was very happy for her sake when I saw her married
to the man she loved. It was a selfish repining that made me ask
for her just now. I would not have her summoned here for worlds.
She is so happy at Venice&mdash;happy in her honeymoon dream. Tell her
nothing, Martin&mdash;nothing till you can tell her that my days have ended
peacefully. She has borne her burden for me in the past. I want her to
be free from all care about me&mdash;but not to forget me."</p>

<p>"She will not forget, Isola. She loves you fondly and truly."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure of that. She was dearer to me than my own sister&mdash;cared
for me much more than Gwendolen ever cared, though Gwen and I were
always good friends. Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> feather-headed Gwen! She writes me
affectionate letters, hoping she may get to Italy in the autumn, though
it is impossible for her to come just now. And mother and father write
to me just in the same way&mdash;mother regretting that her health won't
allow her to leave Dinan; father hoping to see me in the autumn. Their
letters are full of hopefulness," she concluded, with a faint touch of
irony.</p>

<p>Her husband read to her for the greater part of the long gloomy day. He
read St. Thomas à Kempis for some part of the time. The book had been
on the little table by her side throughout her illness. He read two or
three of Frederick Robertson's sermons, and for occasional respite from
too serious thought he read her favourite poems&mdash;Adonaïs, Alastor, and
some of Shelley's lovely lyrics, and those passages in Childe Harold
which had acquired a new charm for her since she had grown familiar
with Rome.</p>

<p>"Read to me about Venice," she said, "and let me think of Allegra and
Captain Hulbert. I love to fancy them gliding along those narrow,
picturesque streets, in the great, graceful, ponderous gondola I
remember so well. It is so nice to know of their happiness&mdash;and to know
that they need never be parted."</p>

<p>So the long summer day&mdash;without the glow and glory of summer&mdash;wore
on, and except for her excessive languor and feebleness there were no
indications that the patient's state was any worse than it had been for
some weeks. The doctor came late in the afternoon, and felt her pulse,
and talked to her a little; but it was easy to see that his visit was
only a formula.</p>

<p>"You have such an excellent nurse, Mrs. Disney, that I consider my
position almost a sinecure," he said, smiling at the faithful Tabitha,
who stood waiting for his instructions, and who never forgot the
minutest detail.</p>

<p>Tabitha came in from the adjoining bedroom every now and then, and
adjusted the pillows on the sofa, and sprinkled eau de Cologne, or
fanned the invalid with a large Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> fan, or arranged the silken
coverlet over her feet, or brought her some small refreshment in the
way of a cup of soup or jelly, and tenderly coaxed and assisted her to
take it, talking just as much or as little as seemed prudent, always
careful neither to fatigue nor excite her charge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was between eight and nine in the evening, and there was a gloomy
twilight in the loggia, and in the garden beyond. The wind which had
dropped in the afternoon had begun to rage again, as if not only Nero
but all the wicked emperors were abroad in the air.</p>

<p>Isola had begged that one of the windows might be opened, in spite of
the tempestuous weather; and the cold damp breath of the storm crept
into the room and chilled Martin Disney as he sat by his wife's sofa,
reading a London paper that had come by the evening post.</p>

<p>Tho only artificial light in the room was a reading-lamp at the
colonel's elbow, shaded from the draught by the four-leaved screen
which protected the invalid. The gloomy grey daylight had not quite
faded, and through the half-open door opposite him Martin Disney saw
the white marble wall of the staircase, and some oleanders in stone
vases that stood on the spacious landing.</p>

<p>He had been reading to Isola nearly all day. He was reading to himself
now, trying to forget his own grief in the consideration of a leading
article which prophecied a European war, and the ultimate extinction of
English influence in continental politics.</p>

<p>There was perfect stillness in the room. Isola had been lying with
closed eyes a little time before, and he fancied that she was sleeping.</p>

<p>The silence had lasted for nearly an hour, broken only by the shriek
of the wind, and by the chiming of the quarters from the Church of La
Trinità de' Monti, when Colonel Disney was startled by his wife's hand
clutching his arm, and his wife's agitated whisper sounding close to
his ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>"Martin! Did you see him?"</p>

<p>She had lifted herself into a sitting position, she who had not been
able to sit up for many days past.</p>

<p>The hectic bloom had faded from her cheeks and left them ashy pale. Her
eyes seemed almost starting from her head, straining their gaze as if
to penetrate the deepening shadows on the landing beyond the half-open
door.</p>

<p>"My love, you have been dreaming," said Disney, soothing her with
womanly gentleness. "Lie down again, my poor dear. See, let me arrange
the pillows and make you quite comfortable."</p>

<p>"No, no! I was not dreaming. I have not been asleep. He was there. I
saw him as plainly as I see you. He pushed the door a little further
open and looked in at me. I saw his face in the lamplight, very pale."</p>

<p>Disney glanced at the door involuntarily. Yes, the aperture was
certainly wider than when he looked at it last; just as if some one's
hand had pushed the door a little further back. The hand of the wind,
no doubt.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, believe me, you were dreaming. No one could have
approached that doorway without my hearing them."</p>

<p>"I have been lying awake thinking all the time you have been reading
your paper, Martin. I never had less inclination to sleep. I know that
he was there looking in at me, with a smile upon his pale face. But he
has gone. Thank God, he has gone! Only I can't help wondering how he
came there, without our hearing his step upon the stone stair."</p>

<p>"Who was it, Isola?"</p>

<p>He knew what the answer would be. He thought her mind was wandering,
and he knew there was only one image which could so agitate her.</p>

<p>"Lostwithiel."</p>

<p>"A delusion, Isa. Lord Lostwithiel is far away from Rome. Come, dear
love, let me read to you again, and let us have our good Tabitha in to
cheer you with a cup of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> tea, and to brighten up the room a little.
We have been growing low-spirited under the influence of the gloomy
weather."</p>

<p>He went out of the room on pretence of summoning Tabitha, and having
sent her to watch beside his wife, he ran quickly downstairs to find
out if the street door were open or closed. The door was shut and
bolted. The servants on the ground floor had not opened the door to any
one after five o'clock. There was no possibility of any stranger having
entered the house since that hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The end came that night, with an appalling suddenness. Isola had
refused to be carried back to her bedroom at the usual time. She
seemed to have a horror of going back to that room, as if the shadows
lurking there were full of fear. Even Father Rodwell's presence, which
generally had a soothing effect upon her nerves and spirits, failed to
comfort her to-night. She refused to lie in her usual position, and
insisted upon sitting up, supported by pillows, facing the doorway at
which her fancy had evoked Lostwithiel's image. She would not allow
the door to be shut, and there was the same strained look in her too
brilliant eyes all the evening.</p>

<p>Father Rodwell read aloud to her, continuing a history of St. Cecilia,
in which she had been warmly interested; but to-night he could see that
her thoughts were not with the book. He read on all the same, hoping
that the sound of his voice might lull her to sleep. The wind had gone
down as the night advanced, and the stars were shining in the strip of
sky above the Pincian Gardens. Colonel Disney was pacing up and down
the loggia, smoking his pipe in the cool darkness&mdash;full of saddest
apprehensions.</p>

<p>Her mind had been wandering, surely, when she had that fancy about
Lostwithiel, he told himself. It was something more than a dream. And
then he remembered those long nights of delirium after her boy was
born&mdash;and above all, that one night, when she had fancied herself at
sea in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> storm, when she had tried to fling herself overboard. He knew
now what scene she had re-acted in that delirium, what the vision was
which a mind distraught had conjured out of empty darkness.</p>

<p>The priest left them before eleven o'clock, and Martin Disney sat with
his wife till long after midnight&mdash;Tabitha waiting quietly in the next
room&mdash;before he could persuade her to go to bed. Isola was more wakeful
than usual&mdash;though her slumbers had been much broken of late&mdash;and there
was a restlessness about her which impressed her husband as a sign of
evil.</p>

<p>"Is the storm over?" she asked, by-and-by, with her face turned towards
the loggia and the starlight above the garden.</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest, all is calm now."</p>

<p>"And the boy?" she said, suddenly looking up at the ceiling above which
the child slept with his nurse. "He is asleep, of course."</p>

<p>"I hope so. I went upstairs at nine o'clock, while Father Rodwell was
reading to you, and gave him my goodnight kiss. He was fast asleep."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he will ever think of me when he is a man?" she said
musingly.</p>

<p>"Can you doubt that? You will be his most sacred memory."</p>

<p>"Ah," she replied, "he will never know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence remained unfinished.</p>

<p>"Will you carry me to my bed, Martin? The room begins to grow dark,"
she whispered faintly. "I can hardly see your face."</p>

<p>He lifted the wasted form in his arms, and carried her with tenderest
care into the next room, and to the pure white bed which had been made
ready for her, the long net curtains parted, the coverlet turned down.
He laid her there, as he had done many a night during that slow and
monotonous journey towards the grave; but her gentle acknowledgment of
his carefulness was wanting to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> Her head sank upon the pillow,
her pale lips parted with a fluttering sigh, and all was still.</p>

<p>This was how the end came&mdash;suddenly, painlessly. She died like an
infant falling asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel Disney laid his wife in the place she had loved, the cemetery
under the shadow of the old Roman wall, in a verdant corner near
Shelley's grave.</p>

<p>Burial follows death with dreadful swiftness in that southern land, and
the earth closed over Isola before noon of the day after her death.</p>

<p>Martin Disney waited to see the new-made grave covered with summer's
loveliest blossoms before he left the cemetery and went back to the
house to which he had taken his fading wife in the radiant Italian
springtime. He paced the desolate rooms, and wandered in and out
between the drawing-room and the sunny bedroom, with its snowy
curtained bed, and looked at this object and that with tear-dimmed eyes
and an aching heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was gone. That page of his life was closed for ever. And now he
had but one purpose and one desire&mdash;to settle his account with the
scoundrel who had destroyed her. He had waited till she was at rest:
and now the long agony of waiting was over. Nothing could touch <i>her</i>
more; and he was free to bring her seducer to book.</p>

<p>He had telegraphed in the morning to Captain Hulbert at Venice, but
there had been no reply so far; and he could only suppose that Allegra
and her husband had left the city upon one of those excursions which
his sister had described to him as diversifying their quiet life in
their palace on the grand canal. He had not been at home long, and
his tired eyes were still dazed and blinded by the flood of sunlight
which the servants had let in upon the rooms after the funeral, when a
telegram was brought to him.</p>

<p>It was from Brindisi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <i>Eurydice</i> went down with all hands last night, off Smyrna. My
brother was on board. I am on my way to Greece. If you can be spared go
to Allegra.&mdash;Hulbert."</p>

<p>Martin Disney knew later that it was between eight and nine o'clock
that the <i>Eurydice</i> struck upon a rock, and every soul on board her
perished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The boy and his nurse went back to Trelasco under Tabitha's escort,
and they were followed to Cornwall soon afterwards by the new Lord
Lostwithiel and his wife, who established themselves at the Mount, to
the great satisfaction of the neighbourhood, where it was felt that
the local nobleman had again become a permanent institution. Allegra
and her husband took Martin Disney's son under their protection in the
absence of his father, who carried a heavy heart back to the jungle and
the tent, trying to find distraction and forgetfulness in the pursuit
of big game, and who did not revisit the Angler's Nest till two years
after his wife's death, when he returned to live a tranquil life among
the books in the library which he had built for himself, and to watch
the growth of his son, whose every look and tone recalled the image of
his dead wife. Sometimes, on drowsy summer afternoons, smoking his pipe
under the tulip tree, while the Fowey river rippled by in the sunshine,
it seemed to him as if Isola's pensive loveliness, and the years that
he had lived with her, and the tears that he had shed for her, and the
infinite pity which had blotted out all sense of his deep wrong, were
only the transient phases of a long sad dream&mdash;the dream of a love that
never was returned.</p>

<p>"And yet, and yet," he said to himself, after lengthened meditation,
with unseeing eyes fixed upon the movement of the tide, "I think she
loved me. I think her heart was mine from the hour her tears welcomed
me back to this house, until her last sigh. God help all young wives
whom their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> husbands leave alone in their youth and beauty to stand or
fall in the hour of temptation!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Idly exploring the contents of the secretaire in the drawing-room one
day, Martin Disney found the telegraphic message which his wife had
written&mdash;and left unsent&mdash;before the Hunt Ball.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
